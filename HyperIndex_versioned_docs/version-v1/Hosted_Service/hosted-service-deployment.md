> For subsequent releases, we strongly recommend setting branch protection rules that prevent direct pushes to your release branch. Instead, making pull requests from a feature branch into the release branch is recommendedðŸ““

## Deployment limits

Developers can deploy 3 indexers per organisation and 3 deployments per indexer. Deployments can be deleted in the hosted service to make space for more deployments.
