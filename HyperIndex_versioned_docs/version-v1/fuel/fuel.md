Until recently, Envio was only available on EVM-compatible blockchains, and now we have extended support to the Fuel Network ðŸ™Œ

## About Fuel

[Fuel](https://fuel.network/) is an operating system purpose-built for Ethereum rollups. Fuel's unique architecture allows rollups to solve for PSI (parallelization, state minimized execution, interoperability). Powered by the FuelVM, Fuel aims to expand Ethereum's capability set without compromising security or decentralization.

## HyperFuel

HyperFuel is [HyperSync](/docs/HyperSync/overview) adapted for the [Fuel Network](https://fuel.network/) and is exposed as a low-level API for developers and data analysts to create niche, flexible, high-speed queries for all on-chain data.

Users can interact with the HyperFuel in Rust, Python client, Node Js, or JSON API to extract data into parquet files, arrow format, or as typed data.

Using HyperFuel, application developers can easily sync and search large datasets in a few minutes.

You can integrate with HyperFuel using any of our clients:

- Rust: https://github.com/enviodev/hyperfuel-client-rust
- Python: https://github.com/enviodev/hyperfuel-client-python
- Nodejs: https://github.com/enviodev/hyperfuel-client-node
- JSON API: https://github.com/enviodev/hyperfuel-json-api

> HyperFuel supports Fuel's testnet at the endpoint https://fuel-testnet.hypersync.xyz

## HyperIndex

[HyperIndex](../overview.md) is a real-time indexer built to provide developers with a seamless and efficient indexing solution.

Learn [How to Index Data on Fuel in \<5mins using Envio](../Tutorials/tutorial-indexing-fuel.md) in a step-by-step tutorial.

Or gain inspiration from already running indexers built by other developers on Fuel:

- [Spark](https://sprk.fi/) Orderbook Indexer [`github`](https://github.com/compolabs/spark-envio-indexer)
- Thunder Exchange Indexer [`github`](https://github.com/enviodev/fuel-thunder-exchange)
- Greeter Indexer [`github`](https://github.com/enviodev/fuel-greeter)

### State of the art

`HyperIndex` on Fuel supports all relevant features EVM indexer does, including [Dynamic Contracts / Factories](../Advanced/dynamic-contracts.md), [Testing Framework](/docs/HyperIndex/testing), [No-code Quickstart](/docs/HyperIndex/contract-import), [Hosted Service](../Hosted_Service/hosted-service.md) and more.

### Supported Event Types

Envio supports many different event types for indexing on Fuel Network.

The default and most flexible one is indexing `LOG_DATA` receipts, which are created by the `log` calls in a [Sway](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway/) contract.

This is similar to `emit` in Solidity contracts but much more flexible because you can pass any data to the Sway `log` function, not only events declared beforehand.

To add an event for a `LOG_DATA` receipt in your contract config, you need to add the name used for the generated code and `logId`, which you can find in the ABI file:

```
events:
  - name: NewGreeting
    logId: "8500535089865083573"
```

If the name matches the logged struct name in Sway, you can omit the `logId` field. We will derive it automatically from the config file.

> ðŸ“– Also, to avoid manually extracting logIds from ABI, you can use the [contract import](/docs/HyperIndex/contract-import), which will automatically generate the config file with events you want to index.

Compared to EVM, Fuel allows indexing `Mint`, `Burn`, `Transfer` and `Call`:

```
events:
  - name: Mint
```

In case you want to change the name to something else, you can use the `type` field:

```
events:
  - name: MintMyNft
    type: mint
```

> ðŸ“– All event types support [wildcard mode](/docs/HyperIndex/wildcard-indexing)

#### Transfer Event Type

The `Transfer` event type combines the `TRANSFER` and `TRANSFER_OUT` receipts into a single event. The first one is emitted when a contract transfers tokens to another contract, and the second one when a contract transfers tokens to a wallet. For better Developer Experience we group them into a single type.

> ðŸ“– Transfers between wallets are not included in the `Transfer` event type.

### Migration Guide from the `envio@2.x.x-fuel` version

With the V2.3 release, we merged the Fuel indexer into the main `envio` repo. This means that you can now use the `envio` version to run both Fuel and EVM indexers.

However, if you are using the `envio` version suffixed with `-fuel`, you will need to migrate to the new version. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes to do so.

To migrate, start with updating the package version:

```bash
pnpm i envio@latest
```

> If you installed `envio` globally, you will also need to run `pnpm i -g envio@latest`

Add `ecosystem: fuel` to your `config.yaml` file.

Then in your handlers rename `data` to `params`:

```diff
SwayFarmContract.NewPlayer.handler(async ({ event, context }) => {
  context.Player.set({
-   id: event.data.address.payload.bits,
-   createdAt: event.time,
+   id: event.params.address.payload.bits,
+   createdAt: event.block.time,
    ...
  });
});
```

Also, some other event fields were moved:

- `time` -> `block.time`
- `blockHeight` -> `block.height`
- X => `block.id`
- `transactionId` -> `transaction.id`
- `contractId` -> `srcAddress`
- `receiptIndex` -> `logIndex`
- `receiptType` -> removed

These are all Fuel-related changes, but if you use `loaders` follow the [v1 to v2 migration guide](/docs/HyperIndex/migration-guide-v1-v2) to update to the V2 API.
