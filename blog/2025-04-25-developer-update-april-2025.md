Welcome to Our April 2025 Developer Update!

This month, we launched v2.16.0 & v2.17.0, introducing Topic Filters by Contract Addresses for more precise indexing and a new development console to track indexer progress. We've also expanded indexing support for Monad and released tools like Snubb for token approval scanning and Loggregate for real-time EVM event data aggregation and much more. Let's jump in!


## üöÄ HyperIndex Version 2.16.0 & 2.17.0 are now available üöÄ

*Please note: Current release 2.17.1*


### Topic Filters by Contract Addresses

Besides **<code>chainId</code>** added in the previous release, you can now also access contract addresses to filter by. 

For example, index your users' USDC transfers as easily as:


```
import { FactoryContract, UserContract } from "generated";

const USDC_ADDRESS = {
  84532: "0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e",
  11155111: "0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238",
};

FactoryContract.UserCreted.contractRegister(async ({ event, context }) => {
  context.addUserContract(event.params.userContractAddress);
});

UserContract.Transfer.handler(async ({ event, context }) => {
  // Filter and store only the USDC transfers that involve a Safe address
  if (event.srcAddress === USDC_ADDRESS[event.chainId]) {
    context.Transfer.set({
      id: `${event.chainId}_${event.block.number}_${event.logIndex}`,
      from: event.params.from,
      to: event.params.to,
    });
  }
}, {
  wildcard: true,
  eventFilters: ({ addresses }) => [{ from: addresses }, { to: addresses }],
});
```



### New Development Console! 

V2.17.0 also went live, allowing you to track indexer progress, access the GraphQL Playground, and level up your local dev experience, with plenty more features on the way! üëá

### Logger improvements üìù

Added the ability to pass params on a log call:


```
context.log.info("Sucessfully handled Transfer()", { from: event.params.from, to: event.params.to })

These params will be displayed in the logs in your terminal as well as in Hosted Service.

You can also pass an error:
} catch (error) {
  context.log.error("Failed ipfs call", error)
}
```

## Envio Delivers Modular, Real-Time Indexing for Monad Builders

<img src="/blog-assets/dev-update-april-2025-2.png" alt="logtui" width="100%"/>

We‚Äôre excited to announce that Envio‚Äôs open indexing framework now supports developers building on Monad. [Monad](https://www.monad.xyz/) is pushing the boundaries of performance at the execution layer, and Envio ensures your data pipeline keeps up seamlessly. Instantly index real-time and historical data on Monad using Envio, fast, reliable, and fully customizable. Track complex state changes, power prediction markets, or build whatever you‚Äôre working on with full control over how your data flows.

We‚Äôre proud to support Monad developers with the fastest blockchain indexing solution available.


## Introducing Snubb: A Multichain Token Approval Scanner for Your Terminal

<img src="/blog-assets/dev-update-april-2025-3.png" alt="logtui" width="100%"/>

Inspired by [Revoke](https://revoke.cash/), Snubb is an incredibly fast and efficient CLI tool to scan for outstanding token approvals for your address across as many as 70 chains simultaneously.

Try it out now with one terminal command:


```
npx snubb --address <your-address> --chains 1,10,130
```


For example:


```
npx snubb --address 0x7C25a8C86A04f40F2Db0434ab3A24b051FB3cA58 --chains many-networks
```


Check out this [video](https://x.com/jonjonclark/status/1907821189789016415) to see it in action.

It‚Äôs lightning fast, able to scan multiple chains and return results in seconds. Under the hood, it uses HyperSync to scan entire chains quickly, with specific filters for approval and transfer events related to the given address.

If you're curious, feel free to check out the original background [post](https://x.com/jonjonclark/status/1907821187469541781) on X that kicked this all off.



## Introducing Loggregate: A Terminal-Native Tool for Real-Time EVM Event Data Aggregation

<img src="/blog-assets/dev-update-april-2025-4.png" alt="logtui" width="100%"/>

We‚Äôre excited to introduce [Loggregate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/loggregate), inspired by [LogTUI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/logtui). It‚Äôs a terminal-native tool that lets developers aggregate and analyze EVM event data in real-time. Whether it‚Äôs token transfers, swaps, or deposits, Loggregate makes it easy to pull meaningful data from Ethereum and other networks.

With Loggregate, you can quickly calculate key statistics like counts, sums, and averages, all within your terminal. For example, we aggregated live transfer data to reveal 127 million transfers with an average value of $111,727 per transaction.

Built for developers and powered by [HyperSync](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/overview), Loggregate is fully open-source and extensible.

Try it out now:


```
npx loggregate -e "event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)" -n eth -p "value" -c 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 -d 6
```


Explore it on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/loggregate) and check out the open-source [repo](https://github.com/denhampreen/loggregate).

## Featured Developer üßë‚Äçüíª

<img src="/blog-assets/dev-update-april-2025-8.png" alt="logtui" width="100%"/>

This month, we‚Äôre excited to feature Manu Soman, a talented developer who transitioned from UX design to mastering backend programming in Rust and JavaScript. Manu‚Äôs work primarily revolves around systems programming and crypto, with a special focus on Solana. Recently, he‚Äôs been expanding his skill set by exploring Go.

Manu has been actively building out the UniV3 Indexer (coming soon) using Envio, a custom-built multi-chain indexer for Uniswap V3 powered by HyperIndex. This project tracks top swaps, pools, and trends in real-time, providing invaluable insights into liquidity, trading volumes, fees, and more!

His passion for exploring new technologies and creating robust solutions makes him a standout developer and member of our community.

***‚ÄúThough my prior experience with blockchain indexers is limited to a small project using Subgraph, I was amazed at how quickly HyperIndex was able to index high-traffic smart contracts like Uniswap. Not only is it fast, it‚Äôs also easy to set up and fully syncs with chains. Subgraph fell short in all of those areas. Envio's tech support on Discord is also active, responsive, and super helpful. Choosing Envio for indexing is a no-brainer.‚Äù - Manu Soman***

We‚Äôre excited to see where Manu‚Äôs journey takes him next and appreciate his contributions to our community.

Be sure to follow Manu and his work on [X](https://x.com/manu_221b) for the latest updates and insights!
