Ahoy Developers!

Welcome to our second monthly community update, where we'll give you an exclusive look into what the Envio team has been hard at work on in the past month. Just like last time, we'll cover upcoming events, technical developments, and exciting milestones. So, grab your favorite beverage, and let's dive in! ☕

This month we kicked off the Envio Bounty Program! 🤑

We publicly released two bounties with prizes of up to $350 in our [Discord](https://www.notion.so/9d8e77645e7d4605a9d04c822aec5bba?pvs=21) that were snatched up in seconds by the legends in our community Rex and Speedfox. The bounties that were up for grabs included an indexer template for on-chain governance and an indexer template for tokenized vaults. Big ups to these legends who participated and knocked it out of the park!

We’ll continue to offer various bounties that are primarily focused on the creation of interesting use cases and templates throughout the coming days and all Envio bounties will be publicly released in our Discord, but first come first serve!

More details [here](https://x.com/envio_indexer/status/1704136858874052974?s=20).

In addition, Envio has partnered with Linea as a [dynamic indexing framework](https://docs.linea.build/build-on-linea/tooling/data-indexers/envio) to supercharge applications built on top of Linea. Envio Hypersync has support for Linea's mainnet and is also being rolled out to the testnet. Say goodbye to slow RPC indexing speeds, and say hello to blazingly fast indexing for an improved developer experience.

Our Greeter tutorial is also live on [Linea](https://linea.build/), similar to our Greeter tutorial launched on Polygon, this tutorial takes you through a step-by-step guide to indexing a simple live Greeter smart contract and serves as a great multi-chain introduction for aggregating cross-chain data. You can read more about it in Linea’s [blog](https://docs.linea.build/blog/index-greeter-contract-using-envio).

We’re thrilled to announce that Envio has also been listed on Alchemy’s Dapp Store list of best [indexing tools](https://www.alchemy.com/dapps/envio) in Web3 and that we’ve partnered with the fantastic team at Encode Club for [the ETH London](https://www.encode.club/eth-london) hackathon where we’ll be hosting an exciting workshop that will include some awesome bounty prizes! More details dropping soon!

During our shipping rampage, we also linked up with the wonderful [Solidity Fridays](https://twitter.com/SolidityFridays) team where our very own co-founder [Jonjon Clark](https://twitter.com/jonjonclark) took us through Envio as a modern blockchain indexing solution, how to design smart contracts keeping events in mind, how to store data, and loads more!

Full video [here](https://x.com/SolidityFridays/status/1705160533656105275?s=20).

Last, but not least, we’re pumped to announce that the Envio Hypersync feature, a blazingly fast indexed layer on top of the blockchain, is live and allows for hyper-speed syncing in what would usually take hours to sync ~100,000 events can now be done in the order of less than a minute. Pretty neat hey!? 😎

### **Upcoming Events ⭐**

1. **ETHLondon 3-Day Hackathon**: Later in October, we'll be hosting a workshop and bounty opportunities at the ETHLondon 3-Day Hackathon from October 27-29 at 8 Northumberland Avenue, London, hosted by Encode Club.
2. **ETH Lisbon:** Early in November we’ll be attending the ETH Lisbon hackathon from the 3rd-5th, get your hands on some exclusive Envio stickers and grab a pastiche de nata and a cold one with the team.

### **Technical Overview 🏗️**

**New release 🚀**

We’re thrilled to announce that we have released a new version of Envio, v0.0.16!

**Authentication Setup**: 🔐

We've implemented Github authentication to allow users to log in to our user interface. This ensures secure login for our users to interact with our hosted system. [COMING SOON].

**Indexer Info in Database**: 💽

We've integrated indexer information, including root directories and configuration files, into our database. This information can now be used seamlessly in the deployment process.

**Init Template Tests**: 🧪

We've added basic tests for init templates to run in the pipeline, ensuring the reliability of our development processes.

**Indexer Views**: 🌅

Added views of indexers with basic information, making it easier to manage and track them on the hosted service UI.

**Mutations for Indexer Config**: 🎛️

We've mapped out mutations for indexer configuration that allow users to customize their deployment process. This streamlines the process of adding new indexers and configuring them.

Stay tuned for more monthly updates and hop in our Discord for more up-to-date information. Exciting times are ahead, and we’re thrilled to have you along for the ride. Until next time, stay curious and keep up the good shipping! 🚢

LFG!
