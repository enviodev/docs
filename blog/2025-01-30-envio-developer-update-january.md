Before this big release, the RPC data source in HyperIndex had several limitations and lacked many of the features available in the HyperSync data source. We‚Äôre excited to announce that this has now been resolved! 

You‚Äôre no longer tied to HyperSync or held back when adding new chains that aren‚Äôt supported yet. HyperIndex is now a fully equipped RPC indexer, ready for anything! üí™

**What's changed for the RPC data source?** 

* Wildcard Indexing support for the RPC data source.
* Pre-registration support for the RPC data source.
* Event Filtering support for the RPC data source when applied to a single wildcard event.
* Transaction input and value fields support for the RPC data source.
* Improved RPC retries on block range error.

## Indexing Contract Events with Envio HyperSync 

<img src="/blog-assets/envio-developer-community-january-2025-2.png" alt="Indexing Conract Events" width="100%"/>


Intuition recently shared their experience using Envio HyperSync to index contract events efficiently with Rust. They highlighted how HyperSync‚Äôs real-time data extraction, multi-chain support, and extreme speed‚Äîscanning 200M blocks in 10 seconds‚Äîenhanced their infrastructure.

Their open-source envio-indexer crate enables seamless event indexing, supporting both database storage and direct streaming to SQS. They also provided a Dockerized setup for scalability and portability.

For those looking to build high-performance indexers, their example showcases how HyperSync simplifies the process while ensuring reliability.

## New Guide: Getting Price Data in Your Indexer

Need price data in your indexer? Whether it's for historical token transfers or Uniswap TVL calculations, there are three ways to fetch prices: Oracles, DEX pools, and Offchain APIs.



* Oracles (e.g., API3, Chainlink) push price updates on-chain but may lag behind real-time values.

* DEX pools (e.g., Uniswap V3) offer decentralized price data but can be impacted by low liquidity and manipulation.

* Offchain APIs (e.g., CoinGecko) provide broad historical data but come with latency and paywall restrictions.


Each method has trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and decentralization‚Äîchoose what fits your use case. üöÄ

His earlier work includes building settlement engines for gaming businesses and creating multi-step data ingestion pipelines, APIs, CLIs, and TUIs.

In addition, Luis wrote the outstanding blog on indexing contract events using HyperSync mentioned above. A huge shoutout to Luis for the effort he put into crafting such a detailed, insightful deep dive and for being a stellar member of the Envio community.


***"Using Envio HyperSync has been a game-changer for us. Its simplicity and efficiency are outstanding, making our indexing tasks significantly easier. The excellent documentation allowed us to get up to speed quickly, minimizing the learning curve. We tested several other indexing solutions over the past few months, but Envio HyperSync stood out as the best. Its support for a wide array of networks enabled us to create indexers for different networks swiftly and effortlessly. Instead of spending time developing the solution, we were able to focus on the core business logic. I highly recommend Envio HyperSync for anyone looking for a reliable and efficient indexing solution."*** *- Luis Eduardo Boiko Ferreira, Senior Backend Engineer at Intuition*
