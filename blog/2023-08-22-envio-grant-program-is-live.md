To commemorate the launch of our Alpha release, Envio invites all blockchain developers to apply for the **Envio "Build Bigger. Ship Faster" Grant Program**. The premise is simple yet incredibly rewarding: integrate an interesting or useful use-case with Envio and share your invaluable feedback to receive a grant from a pool of **$10,000 USDC**.

As any seasoned blockchain developer knows, dealing with copious amounts of  disorganized, slow-to-retrieve data stored on the  blockchain can daunting. These difficulties pose significant obstacles for developers, diverting their attention towards infrastructure and maintenance tasks instead of focusing on the core objective of building brilliant dApps. 

This is where blockchain indexing solutions like Envio come in. With its developer-friendly indexing solution, Envio makes receiving, transforming, loading on-chain data a breeze. Whether you're launching a multichain NFT marketplace, starting a DAO, diving into GameFi, or pioneering the next big P2E project, blockchain indexers like Envio serve as an essential building block tailored to your application's unique data needs.

The challenge is to demonstrate how you can build something brilliant using Envio’s customizable, developer-friendly blockchain indexing solution.

## Wondering what to build? 👀

Here are a few use-cases you can ship using Envio:

- A simple decentralized application (DApp).
- A useful dashboard (e.g. DeFi staking opportunity dashboard, aggregating protocol fees, etc).
- Upgrade or migrate an existing use case subgraph to battle-test Envio's capabilities (e.g. GMX v2, Uniswap V3 subgraph).
- An indexer template for popular OpenZeppelin Standards other than ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 (e.g. Governance contracts).
- An indexer template with data handling logic for easily aggregating/calculating SUM / AVG / MIN / MAX values for DApps.

You are more than welcome to apply for a grant with your own idea, or you can take a look at some of the [bounties](https://discord.com/channels/1093188574305857656/1153324195342729336) in our Discord for further inspiration.

Envio supports indexing any EVM blockchain and allows you to:

- **Write in JavaScript, TypeScript, and ReScript:** Configure your event handling in a familiar developer friendly, and widely supported language
- **Transform blockchain data with SQL:** Execute low-latency queries or larger analytics jobs to transform and load data into a schema for your specific project.
- **Publish queries to APIs:** Publish datasets and queries directly to APIs, build dApps on top of Envio, and scale easily.
- **Join on-chain and off-chain data:** Connect indexed blockchain data as well as ingest off-chain data to create flexible API for rich data beyond just what is emitted simply from events on-chain. e.g. modules that efficiently index off-chain NFT metadata
