Welcome to our September 2024 developer update!

We‚Äôre back with another exciting update on the latest and greatest advancements from the Envio team. In this update, we‚Äôll explore our recent release, V2.3.0, highlighting innovative features like [Wildcard Indexing](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/wildcard-indexing), [IPFS](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/ipfs) integration, and more. We‚Äôll also recap key updates from September, including our time at [Token2049](https://www.asia.token2049.com/) and [EthCapeTown](https://www.ethcapetown.com/), upcoming events, partnerships, and other important developments.

## üöÄ Version 2.3.0 is now availableüöÄ

We are excited to announce that the current release is **v.2.4.1**!

**What's changed?**

- **Wildcard Indexing**: Index whole chains by event signature without specifying exact contract addresses.
- **Event Filtering**: Filter events by indexed parameters. Simplify your handler's logic or get new indexing possibilities when joined with the Wildcard Indexing feature.
- **Fuel Merge**: The [Fuel](https://fuel.network/) ecosystem indexer has been integrated into the main repository code. This huge refactoring comes with a big list of benefits and opportunities, click [here](https://x.com/envio_indexer/status/1835977029641982080).

*‚ö° Both Wildcard Indexing and Event Filters are currently only supported with HyperSync. We are working on adding support for RPC mode in the following versions.*

## Wildcard Indexing

Wildcard indexing is a powerful feature that enables you to index all events matching a specified event signature without the need to specify the contract address from which the event was emitted. This capability is particularly beneficial in scenarios where contracts are deployed through factories that do not emit events upon contract creation. Additionally, it facilitates the indexing of events from all contracts implementing a standard, such as ERC20, streamlining the process and enhancing efficiency.

Learn more [here](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/wildcard-indexing).

## IPFS Guide

Check out our new guide on IPFS, a decentralized network designed for storing and sharing data. This guide walks you through the process of fetching IPFS data into your indexer, providing you with the tools to enhance your applications and leverage the power of decentralized storage.

## Our Time at Token2049 and EthCapeTown

We had an incredible experience at both Token2049 and EthCapeTown this month!
