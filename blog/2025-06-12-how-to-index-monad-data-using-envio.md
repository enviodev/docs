Name a better duo? We’ll start. Envio is proud to support developers and data analysts building on Monad by providing the most efficient and reliable access to real-time and historical data on the Monad network through our modular indexing stack. By combining Monad’s exceptional speed with Envio’s powerful blockchain indexing solution, developers can easily build highly performant applications that thrive on fast, reliable, and comprehensive data.

Monad has emerged as a promising new chapter in blockchain performance, delivering unmatched throughput of up to 10,000 transactions per second for developers and users alike. As a fully EVM-compatible Layer 1, Monad combines one-second block times, optimistic parallel execution, and single-slot finality to redefine what is possible on-chain.

In this blog, we will explore why Envio is the best blockchain indexer on Monad and how our indexing stack empowers you to seamlessly sync, query, and leverage data, unlocking everything from analytics dashboards to advanced applications and user-facing experiences.


## What is Monad?

[Monad](https://www.monad.xyz/) is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain built to bring scalability to the EVM without compromising composability. With Monad’s parallel execution engine and focus on low-latency performance, developers can build highly efficient applications that offer higher throughput and lower fees without needing to rewrite existing EVM code.


#### At its core, Monad features:



* One-second block times that reduce transaction finality delays.
* [Parallel execution](https://docs.monad.xyz/monad-arch/execution/parallel-execution) through Monad’s superscalar architecture for efficient transaction processing.
* Single-slot finality powered by [MonadBFT](https://docs.monad.xyz/monad-arch/consensus/monad-bft) consensus, ensuring fast and secure state updates.
* A highly optimized storage layer called [MonadDB](https://docs.monad.xyz/monad-arch/execution/monaddb) for efficient state access and management.
* [RaptorCast](https://docs.monad.xyz/monad-arch/consensus/raptorcast) for efficient block transmission and network performance.
* [Asynchronous execution](https://docs.monad.xyz/monad-arch/consensus/asynchronous-execution) to pipeline consensus and execution, extending the execution time budget.

These features make Monad an ideal foundation for data-rich decentralized applications that demand speed, reliability, and seamless composability.


## Start Indexing Data on Monad


#### HyperIndex

A full-featured blockchain indexing framework that transforms on-chain events into structured, queryable databases with GraphQL APIs. It offers Monad developers a complete indexing solution with schema management and event handling, making data on Monad easily accessible and developer-friendly.

#### HyperSync 

A high-performance data retrieval layer that gives developers unprecedented access to data on Monad. It directly replaces traditional RPC endpoints, delivering up to 10,000x faster data access. HyperSync enables rapid and cost-effective retrieval of both real-time and historical blockchain data and can be used directly for custom data pipelines and specialized applications.

#### HyperRPC

A local RPC proxy that supercharges blockchain data access by mapping standard RPC requests to HyperSync’s ultra-fast data engine. HyperRPC accepts typical RPC calls and translates them into HyperSync queries, dramatically reducing latency and eliminating the bottlenecks of traditional RPC endpoints.

A high-throughput chain deserves infrastructure that can keep up. By utilizing Envio, you can harness the full potential of Monad’s high-throughput environment and build unstoppable applications.


### Additional Features for Monad Indexers Built Using Envio

Envio offers a range of advanced capabilities that make it easy to build rich, flexible data pipelines on Monad:



* **Flexible Language Support**: Configure your event handling in familiar and widely supported languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, or ReScript.
* **No-Code Quickstart**: Autogenerate the key boilerplate for an entire indexer project based on single or multiple smart contracts. Deploy within minutes.
* **Multichain Support**: Aggregate data across multiple networks into a single database and query everything through a unified GraphQL API.
* **Join On-Chain and Off-Chain Data**: Connect indexed blockchain data with off-chain data to create a flexible API that goes beyond simple on-chain event logs, such as integrating external NFT metadata.
* **Factory Contracts**: Automatically register and process events emitted by all child contracts created by a specified factory or dynamic contract.
* **Hosted Service**: The simplest way to deploy production-ready indexers on Monad. A managed service platform for building, hosting, and querying Envio's Indexers with guaranteed uptime and performance service level agreements.

These additional features make Envio the ideal choice for building next-generation data-driven applications on Monad and beyond.
