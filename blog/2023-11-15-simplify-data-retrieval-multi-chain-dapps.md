The idea that a single blockchain would dominate the digital assets industry was widely accepted in the early days of Web3. It was common to witness debates among ETH and [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) "maxis" arguing over which chain would prevail in Web3. However, fast-forwarding to the present day, the emergence of new Layer-1 networks, Layer-2 scaling solutions, and application-specific chains (referred to as Layer-3s), have paved the way for a multi-chain future for Web3. This transition introduced new possibilities for scalability, interoperability, and innovation.

Interoperability, in particular, has created opportunities for projects (incl. blue-chip decentralized applications like [AAVE](https://aave.com/), [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/swap), and [Compound](https://compound.finance/)) to access new markets by deploying dApps across multiple chains. For example, Uniswap is currently operational across over 8+ EVM blockchains, including [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/), [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), [Base](https://base.org/), [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en), [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/), and [Celo](https://celo.org/). This deployment strategy demonstrates how dApps can improve user acquisition and profitability by leveraging the benefits of multi-chain technology.

As the multi-chain universe takes center stage, there is a growing demand for innovative solutions to efficiently manage data across various blockchain networks. For blockchain developers, dealing with fragmented sets of data across multiple blockchains presents a significant challenge. In the case of the Uniswap example, conventional indexing solutions require developers to create separate indexers and, depending on the approach, host individual databases, for each chain deployment. This method can quickly lead to the proliferation of multiple infrastructure components, resulting in increased operational maintenance and higher costs. Additional logic on the client-side application would also be required to aggregate and consolidate the data.

Builders deploying their dApps across multiple chains are seeking swift and optimized solutions for accessing data dispersed across these networks. This is where multi-chain indexing comes to the rescue by simplifying complexities and expanding developers' horizons in the Web3 ecosystem. Multi-chain indexing solutions, like Envio, give builders the option to index and aggregate data across multiple networks into a single database, allowing builders to query all of their data with a unified endpoint.

### Envio Multi-Chain Indexing Simplifies Data Retrieval

Envio is thrilled to unveil its latest innovation: multi-chain indexing. This groundbreaking feature heralds a new era in Web3 development, offering builders a seamless way to access fragmented data across multiple chains. With this capability, indexing and accessing data from smart contracts on multiple chains becomes effortless through a unified [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API.

To witness the power of this advancement in action, let's explore a practical example using Envio‚Äôs [Greeter Contract Tutorial](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/greeter-tutorial) further below.

### Multi-chain Greeter Contract Example

The Greeter contract is a very simple smart contract that allows a user to write a greeting message on the blockchain and is deployed on both the [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) and the [Linea](https://linea.xyz/) blockchain, respectively. For this example, we will only look at the `NewGreeting` event.

In the `config.yaml` file, a user would specify the networks, contract specifications and event information to be used in the indexing process.

```yaml
name: Greeter
description: Greeter indexer
#Global contract definitions that must contain all definitions except
#addresses. Now you can share a single handler/abi/event definitions
#for contracts across multiple chains
contracts:
- name: Greeter
abi_file_path: ./abis/greeter-abi.json
handler: ./src/EventHandlers.bs.js
events:
- event: "NewGreeting"
requiredEntities:
- name: "User"
networks:
- id: 137 # Polygon
start_block: 45336336
contracts:
- name: Greeter #A reference to the global contract definition
address: "0x9D02A17dE4E68545d3a58D3a20BbBE0399E05c9c"
- id: 59144 # Linea
start_block: 367801
contracts:
- name: Greeter #A reference to the global contract definition
address: "0xdEe21B97AB77a16B4b236F952e586cf8408CF32A"
```

The Greeter indexer listens to `NewGreeting` events from both the Polygon and Linea [Greeter contracts](https://docs.linea.build/blog/index-greeter-contract-using-envio) to update the Greeting entity.

Through Envio's multi-chain indexing, builders can specify their event handler to operate against a common schema. The `schema.graphql` file would look like this:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  greetings: [String!]!
  latestGreeting: String!
  numberOfGreetings: Int!
}
```

Envio allows users to specify a single handler to process common events across contracts deployed on multiple networks. The code snippet example below uses TypeScript as the preferred language.

```typescript
import {
GreeterContract_NewGreeting_loader,
GreeterContract_NewGreeting_handler,
} from "../generated/src/Handlers.gen";

import { GreetingEntity } *from* "../generated/src/Types.gen";

GreeterContract_NewGreeting_loader(({ event, context }) => {

context.User.load(event.params.user.toString());
...
});

GreeterContract_NewGreeting_handler(({ event, context }) => {
let currentUser = context.User.get(event.params.user);
...

});
```

For a more complicated multi-chain indexing example, builders are encouraged to explore the [Compound V2 Liquidation Metrics](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/example-liquidation-metrics) indexer, built by Envio‚Äôs first successful Grantee as part of the [Envio ‚ÄúBuild Bigger. Ship Faster‚Äù Program](https://docs.envio.dev/blog/envio-grant-program-now-live).
