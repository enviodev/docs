<!--truncate-->

Welcome to our October 2024 developer update! We‚Äôre excited to share the latest version, which features improvements like smoother contract imports and better error handling. This month, we‚Äôre spotlighting our integrations with MIRA Exchange and Gateway.fm, along with our recent success at the Encode hackathon, where the ModuleScan project stood out. Let‚Äôs dive in!

## üöÄ HyperIndex Version 2.6.0 is now available üöÄ

We are excited to announce that the current release is **v.2.6.1**!

**Improvements:**

- feat: prompt for start block on RPC URL networks in contract import
- Improve contract import to stop asking for API keys
- Improve crash error
- Add mainnet selection in Fuel contract import
- Improve Batch Set error

For more information, you can view [all past and current release notes](https://github.com/enviodev/hyperindex/releases) in the Envio github.

## Dynamic Contract Pre-registration

You can now add the **preRegisterDynamicContracts** flag to your event configuration. For events with this flag enabled, the indexer will perform an end-to-end run specifically for these events, executing all relevant **contractRegister** functions to collect dynamic contract addresses. The indexer will then restart with these addresses from the start block configured for the network, rather than from the block where each contract is registered. This approach drastically reduces indexing time for standard factory contract setups, minimizing the need for multiple small block range queries in favor of larger, grouped queries. See the example below.

```typescript
PoolFactory.CreatePool.contractRegister(
  ({ event, context }) => {
    context.addPool(event.params.pool);
    },
    { preRegisterDynamicContracts: true },
);
```
