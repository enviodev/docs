Welcome to our July Developer Update.

This month, we embraced built-in cache for effect calls, improved loaders, added new testing utilities, and introduced more control over output configuration. We also launched a one-click indexer generator, shipped fresh hacks from our internal hackathon, and kept refining the overall developer experience.

We made stops at EthCC and Pragma Cannes too, catching up with builders from across the space. Let‚Äôs dive in! 


## Latest Releases: v2.23.0 ‚Üí v2.26.0

*‚ö†Ô∏èNote: Current Release is v2.26.0*


### Built-in Cache for Effect Calls


```
import { experimental_createEffect, S } from "envio";

export const getMetadata = experimental_createEffect(
  {
    name: "getMetadata",
    input: S.string,
    output: {
      description: S.string,
      value: S.bigint,
    },
    cache: true, // Simply set cache to true
  },
  async ({ input, context }) => {}
})
```


Learn more in our [docs](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/loaders#persistence) about how to persist the cache on reruns and share it with Hosted Service (alpha).


## V2.23.0


### Embracing loaders

In v2.23.0, we added `context.set`, **<code>context.unsafeDelete</code>**, and **<code>context.getOrCreate</code>** to loaders. 

Add **<code>context.isPreload</code>** to distinguish between the first and second loader run. If you are a power user, from now on we recommend going all-in with loaders and keeping your handlers empty.

Learn more in our dedicated loaders [guide](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/loaders#going-all-in-with-loaders).

## Envio Supports Base with Lightning Fast Data Retrieval

<img src="/base-support.png" alt="base support" width="100%"/>


[Base](https://www.base.org/) is booming. Your data should too. Envio‚Äôs HyperSync supports Base with the most advanced indexing on the market. Sync historical data in minutes, access it up to 2000x faster than RPC, and query structured logs, traces, events, and functions.

Learn how to index millions of events in Seconds on Base using Envio in this [thread](https://x.com/envio_indexer/status/1943657401506304443).


## Internal Hackathon July 2025

<img src="/internal-hack-turkey.png" alt="internal hack turkey" width="100%"/>

We wrapped up another successful internal hackathon during our team offsite this month. The goal? Build tools that push Envio forward. Some are already live.

We run these every last Thursday of the month, so keep an eye out for more builds. Let us know which one‚Äôs your favourite.

Check out this [thread](https://x.com/envio_indexer/status/1950145932516880605) to see what we built in under 24 hours.

[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) is on fire. ETF inflows are climbing, regulatory clarity is coming, and price action is picking up. The network‚Äôs heating up, but can your infrastructure keep up? Envio‚Äôs HyperSync lets you index millions of events on Ethereum in seconds. No delays. Just fast, structured access to the data that matters.

Learn how in this [thread](https://x.com/envio_indexer/status/1945849077746327639).

Big shoutout to the [EthCC](https://ethcc.io/) team for an incredible event, and to [ETHGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/) for hosting a packed Pragma. Non-stop energy, great convos, and a stacked builder crowd.

We‚Äôre proud to be building alongside some of the sharpest devs and innovators in the space. Huge thanks to everyone who made it happen. Until next time.

## Featured Developer üßë‚Äçüíª

<img src="/dev-of-the-month-july-2025.png" alt="july 2025 DOTM" width="100%"/>


This month‚Äôs featured developer is Nikhil, a software developer and technical content creator who‚Äôs been sharing practical insights with Web3 devs for years. He‚Äôs worked with teams like Figment, Celo, and Bitquery, crafting developer-facing content. Nikhil has also contributed as a Solidity developer on smaller DeFi projects and is now focusing on personal projects while exploring new opportunities.

He recently got hands-on with Envio, using our tools live on stream to build a custom database for [Across Protocol](https://x.com/AcrossProtocol). His clear walkthroughs on his YouTube [channel](http://youtube.com/@decryptedbytes) and detailed feedback have helped surface valuable insights and made our tooling more accessible to the wider community.


    ***‚ÄúI came across Envio through some of the content Jonjon had shared, his projects like [Logtui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/logtui) and [V4](https://www.v4.xyz/), really caught my attention and pushed me to try it out. What I was looking for was a framework that gave me full control and flexibility, and Envio delivers exactly that.***


    ***I‚Äôm currently working on a personal project to build an explorer and analytics platform for Across Protocol, so it felt like a good time to dive into Envio. So far, the experience has exceeded expectations. The documentation is solid, it answers almost every question I‚Äôve had while working with it.‚Äù*** - *Nikhil, Developer & Web3 Educator*

Be sure to follow Nikhil on [X](https://x.com/nikbhintade) and check out their work on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikbhintade) to see what they‚Äôre building next.
