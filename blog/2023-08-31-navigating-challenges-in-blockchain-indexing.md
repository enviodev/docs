The rise of blockchain technology has empowered a new era of possibilities, promising a decentralized, secure, and transparent future. But it's not without its challenges. In this blog article, we'll cover the common hurdles faced in blockchain indexing and shed light on how innovative solutions like Envio are changing the game.

## Common challenges of blockchain indexing

### Underutilized data

Blockchains emit an enormous amount of data and indexing it efficiently can become extremely challenging. Without proper handling, data can be overwhelming, obstructing usability and analysis, demanding the need for an effective indexing solution that streamlines data retrieval into a unified view.

### Sync speeds

Blockchain networks are constantly evolving and staying in sync with real-time data is crucial. However, traditional syncing methods can be slow and request-heavy, delaying access to historical and real-time data. Slow syncing can also be costly in terms of development time and user experience.

### Multichain aggregation

Teams that deploy multichain dApps desire a quick and optimized blockchain indexing solution for aggregating and indexing all the multichain data into a single accessible database. The alternative of setting up multiple infrastructure components for multichain indexing creates additional operational overheads.

### Development hurdles

Developing and hosting your own indexing infrastructure can be a monumental task, requiring specialized skills which take up significant development resources. Blockchain developers require cost-effective infrastructure tools that abstract away the complexities of managing hosted infrastructure and automate much of the set up process to simplify the overall development lifecycle.

### Troubleshooting

When indexing goes wrong, and it can, identifying and resolving issues swiftly is a must. Troubleshooting can be time-consuming with poor error logging and slow sync speeds.

**Users don’t see runtime errors, they see bad apps.**

This can lead to users involuntarily churning toward competitor products. Some indexing solutions offer integrated testing frameworks to increase confidence before deployment.
