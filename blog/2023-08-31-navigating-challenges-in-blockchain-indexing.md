# Navigating common challenges in blockchain indexing

The rise of blockchain technology has empowered a new era of possibilities, promising a decentralized, secure, and transparent future. But it's not without its challenges. In this blog article, we'll cover the common hurdles faced in blockchain indexing and shed light on how innovative solutions are changing the game.

## Common challenges of blockchain indexing

### Underutilized data

Blockchain generates an enormous amount of data, and indexing it efficiently can become quite challenging. Without proper organization, data can be overwhelming, obstructing usability and analysis, demanding the need for an effective indexing solution that streamlines data retrieval into a unified view.

### Sync speeds

Blockchain networks are constantly evolving, and staying in sync with real-time data is crucial. However, traditional syncing methods can be slow and request heavy, delaying access to historical data. Slow syncing can also be costly in terms of development time and user experience.

### Multi-chain aggregation

Indexing for multi-chain dApps can quickly result in additional infrastructure to maintain, such as multiple API endpoints and databases.

### Development hurdles

Developing indexers often involves manual coding, which can lead to errors and slowed productivity. Blockchain developers require infrastructure tools that automate code generation, boosting efficiency. There is a huge desire for a solution that not only provides automatic code generation but simplifies the overall development lifecycle.

### Troubleshooting

When indexing goes wrong, and it can, identifying and resolving issues swiftly is a must. Troubleshooting can be time-consuming with poor error logging and slow sync speeds. Users don’t see runtime errors, they see bad apps. This can lead to user’s involuntary churning toward competitor products. Some indexing solutions offer integrated testing frameworks to increase confidence before deployment.
