# Envio Celebrates Azuro Multichain Blockchain Indexer Grantee
[insert asset 1]

We’re thrilled to share that Alex Urban, a Python developer at TradingStrategy, has completed the [Envio and Azuro “Multichain Indexer” Grant](https://docs.envio.dev/blog/envio-azuro-developer-grant-multi-chain-indexer). Alex developed an advanced multichain blockchain indexer for the [Azuro Protocol](https://azuro.org/) using Envio’s SDK, helping to boost the performance of Azuro’s decentralized betting platform. Alex was awarded a $1500 USDC grant for this achievement. This milestone showcases the power of Envio’s multichain data indexing solution for decentralized betting applications like Azuro.


## Grant Overview

Earlier this year, Azuro and Envio launched the developer grant for multichain indexing, inviting developers to create an open-source indexer capable of seamlessly aggregating data across multiple blockchain networks. The goal: build a faster, more efficient indexing solution for the Azuro Protocol using Envio’s SDK.

Alex completed this grant by building an indexer capable of processing millions of events from Azuro’s v1, v2, v3, and mainnet deployments. This reduced indexing times significantly, particularly on the Gnosis blockchain, where the entire event history was indexed in under an hour.


### Technical Scope

The scope of the multichain indexer is limited to [Gnosis](https://www.gnosis.io/) and [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) production contract deployments.



* The event handlers of the Envio indexer should be written in TypeScript. \

* The indexer involves configuring schema.graphql, config.yaml, and handlers.ts files. \

* Envio SDK version for the indexer should be version 0.0.29 or higher.

## Multichain Indexing Across Multiple Networks

The Azuro protocol roughly handles over 5.5 million events on the Gnosis blockchain alone and relies on efficient indexing to extract and organize data related to its smart contracts. Alex’s indexer efficiently processes event data from Azuro’s v1, v2, v3, and mainnet, making it fast and efficient to query and analyze this data.

By leveraging Envio’s multichain indexing infrastructure, Alex was able to aggregate data across different blockchain deployments, reducing fragmentation and streamlining access through a unified GraphQL API. This approach simplified the querying process, allowing Alex to retrieve complex betting data with ease.

The Azuro indexer extracts and indexes multichain blockchain data relating to the Azuro protocol. This makes it fast and easy to query and analyze this data. This includes processed event data from v1, v2, v3, and the livecore of Azuro, which amounts to about 5.5 million events for the Gnosis blockchain, as shown in the above screenshot. 

Using Envio's fast data retrieval tech and caching to avoid RPC calls where possible, this indexer runs significantly faster than its Subgraph counterpart. Currently, on the Gnosis chain, it indexes the entire event history in under 1 hour. Multichain is supported natively in Envio and you just need to add additional chain info to the config to go multi.

***"The Envio team was highly responsive in addressing any queries and discussing possible new features that came up during the development process. It was a pleasure to work with them."  *** Alex Urban - Python Developer at [TradingStrategy](https://tradingstrategy.ai/)
