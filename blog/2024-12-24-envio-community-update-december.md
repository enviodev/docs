<!--truncate-->

Welcome to our December 2024 update! It‚Äôs the most wonderful time of the year, and we want to take a moment to thank each and every one of you for an incredible 2024. Your support, feedback, and contributions have been at the heart of everything we‚Äôve accomplished, and we couldn‚Äôt be more grateful!

This month, we've been busy rolling out new features, integrating with some amazing projects, and continuing to enhance our data indexing solutions. From big milestones with HyperSync to a new DeFi integration with Blocksquare, we‚Äôve got plenty to share. Plus, we‚Äôre diving into some exciting updates from our latest tutorials and partnerships.

We‚Äôre sending you warm wishes for a joyful, restful holiday season with your loved ones. Stay safe, enjoy the festivities, and we‚Äôll see you in the new year.

Happy holidays from all of us at Envio! ‚ö°


## HyperSync Milestone ‚ö°

<img src="/blog-assets/envio-developer-community-december-2024-1.png" alt="HyperSync Milestone #2" width="100%"/>

With nearly 80 billion requests served, [HyperSync](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperSync/overview) is rapidly becoming a top choice as a data source for faster data retrieval than standard RPC. Envio‚Äôs indexer, HyperIndex, supports both RPC and HyperSync as sources for ingesting blockchain data.

The traditional method of retrieving blockchain data relies on RPC, which, although functional, becomes inefficient when querying large amounts of data. Hypersync enables data access up to 1000x faster than a standard node and also provides this data free of charge.  \



## üöÄ HyperIndex Version 2.11.0 is now available üöÄ

We‚Äôre excited to announce the release of **v.2.11.2**! 


### Field Selection per Event

You can now specify field selection for individual events. This feature optimizes RPC and HyperSync calls by fetching only the data relevant to specific events, avoiding over-fetching.

Example:


```
events:
  - event: "Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)"
    field_selection:
      transaction_fields:
        - "to"
        - "from"
```
