When speed is the baseline, precision becomes the edge. Envio proudly supports developers and data analysts building on MegaEth with the most performant real-time indexing stack designed for high-throughput environments. Get fast, reliable access to both real-time and historical data without the usual bottlenecks.

MegaEth is reshaping what real-time looks like on the EVM. With sub-millisecond block times and support for over 100,000 transactions per second, built for next-gen applications that demand scale, speed, and reliability.

In this blog, we’ll walk through how to easily index, sync, and query millions of events on MegaEth in minutes using Envio. From setup to production, learn how to get the most out of one of the fastest chains in the ecosystem.


## What is MegaEth?

[MegaEth](https://www.megaeth.com/) is a high-performance EVM chain purpose-built for real-time applications. It combines sub-millisecond block times with over 100,000 transactions per second, giving developers a foundation to build real-time, responsive, production-grade apps.

Unlike other chains that trade off EVM compatibility for speed, MegaEth keeps your Solidity code, dev tools, and mental models intact. You get Ethereum’s programming experience with none of the latency. Whether you’re powering data analytics, an on-chain game, or a reactive dashboard, MegaEth makes sure your stack never lags behind your users.


#### Key Features:

- [Mini Blocks + EVM Blocks](https://docs.megaeth.com/mini-blocks): Fast mini-blocks (~10 ms) combined with full EVM block finality offer real-time latency and standard blockchain guarantees.

- [High-Throughput Sequencing + Parallel Execution](https://docs.megaeth.com/architecture): MegaEth achieves high TPS through a centralized sequencer architecture and parallel execution across node types. 

- [Realtime API Access](https://docs.megaeth.com/realtime-api): The Realtime API surfaces mini-block data via standard JSON-RPC methods, allowing near-instant visibility into state and transaction outcomes. 


- **EigenDA-Powered Data Availability**: By integrating EigenDA, MegaEth enables scalable, secure data access without burdening Ethereum’s on-chain storage. 

- **Full EVM Support**: MegaEth supports Solidity, EIP‑1559, EIP‑7702, large contract sizes, and existing Ethereum tooling out of the box.


These core building blocks make MegaEth a robust environment for building everything from real-time DeFi and high-frequency trading bots to streaming on-chain gaming and on-demand NFT mints, all at warp speed.


## Start Indexing Data on MegaEth


### HyperIndex

A full-featured blockchain indexing framework that transforms on-chain events into structured, queryable databases with GraphQL APIs. It offers MegaEth developers a complete indexing solution with schema management and event handling, making data on MegaEth easily accessible and developer-friendly.

### HyperSync 

A high-performance data retrieval layer that gives developers unprecedented access to data on MegaEth. It directly replaces traditional RPC endpoints for raw block data, delivering up to 10,000x faster data access. HyperSync enables rapid and cost-effective retrieval of both real-time and historical blockchain data and can be used directly for custom data pipelines and specialized applications.

#### HyperRPC

A local RPC proxy that supercharges blockchain data access by mapping standard RPC requests to HyperSync’s ultra-fast data engine. HyperRPC accepts typical RPC calls and translates them into HyperSync queries, dramatically reducing query time and eliminating the bottlenecks of traditional RPC endpoints.

MegaEth moves fast, and your indexing stack should too. Envio gives you the infrastructure to match that speed, so you can build applications that are responsive, reliable, and ready for scale.


### Additional Features for MegaEth Indexers Built Using Envio

Envio offers a range of advanced capabilities that make it easy to build rich, flexible data pipelines on MegaEth:



* **Flexible Language Suppor**t: Configure your event handling in familiar and widely supported languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, or ReScript.
* **No-Code Quickstart**: Autogenerate the key boilerplate for an entire indexer project based on single or multiple smart contracts. Deploy within minutes.
* **Multichain Support**: Aggregate data across multiple networks into a single database and query everything through a unified GraphQL API.
* **Join On-Chain and Off-Chain Data**: Connect indexed blockchain data with off-chain data to create a flexible API that goes beyond simple on-chain event logs, such as integrating external NFT metadata.
* **Factory Contracts**: Automatically register and process events emitted by all child contracts created by a specified factory or dynamic contract.
* **Hosted Service**: The simplest way to deploy production-ready indexers on MegaEth. A managed service platform for building, hosting, and querying Envio's Indexers with guaranteed uptime and performance service level agreements.

These additional features make Envio the ideal choice for building next-generation data-driven applications on MegaEth and beyond.


## Existing Use Cases on MegaEth Utilizing Envio


### Oracle Wars

<img src="/blog-assets/megaeth-oracle-wars.png" alt="orcale wars megaeth" width="100%"/>

[Oracle Wars](https://www.oraclewars.xyz/) is an experimental dashboard built with Envio’s HyperIndex that visualizes real-time oracle behavior on MegaEth. It showcases how push-based oracles like [RedStone Bolt](https://blog.redstone.finance/2025/04/08/introducing-redstone-bolt-the-fastest-blockchain-oracle-to-date/) behave under live market conditions by tracking heartbeat intervals, deviation thresholds, and latency patterns. The project helps developers understand how oracles operate in volatile environments and the potential risks of delayed or unexpected updates. Built in under two hours, Oracle Wars demonstrates how Envio enables rapid development of real-time monitoring tools on high-throughput chains like MegaEth.

Take a deeper dive in our full [Oracle Wars blog](https://docs.envio.dev/blog/oracle-wars).

This is just one of many great examples of what Envio is powering in the MegaEth ecosystem. For more, explore our [Envio Explorer](https://envio.dev/explorer) and see what developers are building.
