The first-ever Monad hackathon (evm/accathon) brought some serious builder energy. We were proud to support teams with the fastest and most performant data indexing on Monad. 

Huge shoutout to the Monad team and every dev who participated, especially those who built with us. Here’s a look at the two standout winning submissions that used Envio’s open indexing infrastructure to power their projects on Monad.


## Gorillionaire

By [luduvigo](https://x.com/luduvigo), [sammino](https://x.com/sammino__), and [CKobril](https://x.com/CKobril)

[Gorillionaire](https://www.gorillionai.re/) is an AI-powered crypto trading platform delivering real-time Buy/Sell signals by analyzing on-chain data, whale activity, token listings, and price feeds. It uses Envio to index data on Monad, giving users and bots fast access to high-signal, real-time insights.

With [Privy](https://www.privy.io/) for authentication and the [0x](https://0x.org/) API for execution, users can act on signals instantly and compete on a gamified leaderboard. The platform also features AI-generated token analytics and gated access to private signals via [Nillion](https://nillion.com/)’s Secret Vault.

Backed by Monad’s performance and Envio’s real-time indexing infrastructure, Gorillionaire shows what’s possible when AI meets production-grade indexing built for scale. Big congrats to the team on this stellar submission!

## MonFundMe

[MonFundMe](https://monfundme.vercel.app/) is a decentralized fundraising platform built on Monad, offering fast, transparent donations without the friction of Web2. Inspired by GoFundMe but reimagined for Web3, it cuts out high platform fees and removes all-or-nothing fundraising limits.

Powered by Envio, MonFundMe tracks donations in real time, offering complete transparency and faster access to funds. It’s an ideal fit for urgent causes or ongoing community campaigns alike.

Big ups and congrats to the team for an outstanding submission!
