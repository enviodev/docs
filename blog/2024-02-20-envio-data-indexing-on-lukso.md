We’re back with some more exciting news!

LUKSO is bringing blockchain technology to its next frontier and Envio is providing the speed. Envio’s HyperIndex now fully supports developers and analysts building on LUKSO with its hyper-performant query speeds, providing a robust solution to efficiently organise and query real-time and historical on-chain data for their dapps and use cases.

## Why Choose Envio on LUKSO?

[Envio](https://envio.dev/) stands out as a dev-friendly EVM-compatible blockchain data indexing solution empowering developers to reliably read and process real-time and historical smart contract events through a robust [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API.

Envio supports indexing on LUKSO and **any EVM-compatible blockchain**, enabling developers to:

- Flexible language support: Configure your event handling in familiar and widely supported languages, such as [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), or [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/).
- Contract import: Autogenerate a basic indexer and queryable GraphQL API for a single or a set of smart contracts deployed on single or multiple EVM networks in less than 5 minutes
- HyperSync: To ensure blazing-fast retrieval of historical on-chain data and a seamless developer experience, Envio’s HyperSync endpoint allows for 100x faster indexing than standard RPC.
- Multi-chain indexing: Aggregate data stored across multiple networks into a single database, making it super easy to present aggregated information in your front end with a unified GraphQL API.
- Join on-chain and off-chain data: Connect indexed blockchain data as well as ingest data from external sources to create flexible API for rich data beyond just what is emitted simply from events on-chain.

## What Envio Supports on LUKSO?

Envio's HyperIndex equips LUKSO developers with a feature-rich data indexing framework that innovates beyond challenges experienced with traditional indexing solutions. Envio serves as the front door for developers, analysts and applications built on LUKSO to access, transform, and store real-time or historical data from any EVM-compatible smart contracts.

Envio is purpose-built for modern EVM blockchain indexing and extends its support to various EVM blockchains, including Polygon, Avalanche, Linea, Arbitrum, Base, ZkSync, and, of course, Lukso. This enables developers building on the LUKSO network to sync millions of events in minutes, instead of hours, a staggering 100x faster than standard RPC greatly improving the developer experience and performance of blockchain-based applications and use cases on LUKSO.
