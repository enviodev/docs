Real estate has long been considered a reliable investment, yet the entry barriers have traditionally been high. High costs, complex ownership models, and limited liquidity have made the market inaccessible to many. But with the rise of blockchain technology, tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) is shifting the landscape, making property investment more accessible, transparent, and liquid than ever before. This innovation is revolutionizing the real estate market by breaking down barriers and creating new opportunities for global investors. Real estate is expected to become the largest type of tokenized asset by 2030, with the tokenized real estate sector estimated to reach close to $30 billion by 2034, according to Blocksquare.


## What is an RWA?

A Real-World Asset (RWA) refers to any physical asset that has intrinsic value in the real world, such as property, commodities, or even art. These assets have long been the foundation of wealth accumulation, but the traditional processes for transferring and investing in RWAs have been complex, costly, and inefficient. Blockchain technology changes this by enabling the creation of digital representations of RWAs, making them easier to trade, fractionalize, and own.


## How do Tokenized RWAs Work?

Tokenization involves converting a physical asset into a digital token on a blockchain, representing a fraction of the asset's ownership. In the case of real estate, tokenized RWAs are blockchain-based tokens that represent a stake in a property or a collection of properties.

This process allows investors to buy, sell, and trade ownership stakes in real estate with ease. Each token represents a specific portion of ownership in the underlying property, providing access to borderless real estate markets that were once inaccessible due to high capital requirements or jurisdictions. These tokens can be traded on blockchain platforms, increasing liquidity and offering flexibility in a traditionally illiquid market. Protocols like Blocksquare are at the forefront of this shift, helping to bridge traditional real estate with blockchain technology.


## What is Blocksquare?

[Blocksquare](https://blocksquare.io/) is a blockchain platform that enables businesses to tokenize real estate, bridging the gap between traditional property investment and blockchain innovation. The platform provides the tools necessary for businesses to tokenize property values, launch marketplace platforms, and connect interested stakeholders to opportunities in tokenized real estate.

At the heart of Blocksquare is [Oceanpoint](https://oceanpoint.fi/), a DeFi platform where users can stake real estate-backed tokens, earn rewards, and participate in a growing ecosystem of tokenized properties. Powered by the BST utility token, Oceanpoint makes property investment more accessible, transparent, and efficient.

## Why RWAs Matter

Tokenizing real estate brings numerous benefits beyond traditional property investment methods. Here are a few key reasons why tokenization matters:


* **Lower Barriers to Entry:** By fractionalizing property ownership, tokenization allows individuals to invest with smaller amounts of capital, rather than buying entire properties.

* **Liquidity**: Tokenized real estate can be traded, making it much more liquid than traditional real estate investments, which often require years to realize returns.

* **Transparency**: Ownership records are transparent, tamper-proof, and easily verifiable, reducing the risk of fraud or disputes.

* **Global Access**: Investors from around the world can participate in tokenized real estate markets, democratizing access to property investments that were previously limited to local investors or large institutions.

The tokenization of real estate is transforming the industry, making it more efficient and accessible to a wider audience.


## Envio’s Role in Powering Blocksquares Ecosystem

Envio plays a crucial role in powering Blocksquare’s infrastructure, ensuring the seamless operation and scalability of tokenized real estate. What started as a community-driven initiative for Blocksquare has evolved into a strong partnership, with Envio’s advanced blockchain indexing solution now fully integrated into their ecosystem.

By leveraging Envio's indexing infrastructure, Blocksquare benefits from real-time data retrieval, enhanced data management, and improved efficiency. Envio’s platform aggregates data into a unified database, streamlining the process of tracking ownership and transactions, while reducing infrastructure costs and latency.

***"Envio is really onto something. Their tech is fascinating, and the developer experience is unparalleled. After years of working with The Graph, it's refreshing to see new players like Envio pushing the boundaries. The team is responsive, innovative, and a pleasure to work with."*** - Simon Kruse, Head of Web3 Development and Governance Board Member at Blocksquare

Envio optimizes performance significantly, enabling the indexing of over 400,000 Ethereum Mainnet events in under 20 minutes—a task that previously took hours. Envio gives web3 developers an edge with significantly faster access to onchain data, speeding up development and testing cycles, and ensuring scalable data access as applications and blockchain grows in size.
