<!--truncate-->

Welcome to our November 2024 update.

This month, we rolled out v2.9.0, launched our V2 Hosted Service, and celebrated new integrations with Swaylend, Tangle, and more. We also added fresh network support to HyperSync, shared our top AWS cost-saving strategies, and published a Fuel tutorial for building production-ready apps. Plus, we'll cover some highlights of our time at DevCon and ZuThailand. Let's dive in!


## HyperIndex Version 2.9.0 is now available

We're pleased to announce the release of **v.2.9.0**!

**Environment Variables in the config file:**

The Envio config file now supports Environment Variables for greater flexibility. Instead of editing the config file every time, you can quickly switch configurations by setting Environment Variables at runtime.

Note: Hosted Service users can now set custom Environment Variables.

Example:

```
networks:
  - id: ${ENVIO_CHAIN_ID:-137}
    start_block: ${ENVIO_START_BLOCK:-45336336}
    contracts:
      - name: Greeter
        address: ${ENVIO_GREETER_ADDRESSES}
```

Run the following command to set the variables:

```
ENVIO_GREETER_ADDRESSES=0x9D02A17dE4E68545d3a58D3a20BbBE0399E05c9c pnpm dev
```

Alternatively, you can set values via the `.env` file or the Hosted Service indexer settings page.

**Interpolation Syntax:**

To apply interpolation, use the following formats for Environment Variables:

* Direct substitution:  `${VAR}` →  value of `VAR`
* Default value: `${VAR:-default}` → value of `VAR` if set, otherwise `default`
* Alternative default: `${VAR-default}` → value of `VAR` if set, otherwise `default`

For more information, you can view [all past and current release notes](https://github.com/enviodev/hyperindex/releases) on our GitHub.

## Highlights from DevCon & ZuThailand

<img src="/blog-assets/envio-developer-community-november-2024-6.png" alt="Envio DevCon & ZuThailand" width="100%"/>

We had an incredible time at [Devcon](https://devcon.org/en/) 2024 in Bangkok! Envio had the pleasure of co-hosting the [Data & Chill Café](https://lu.ma/w84y3q08) side event, bringing together top builders from around the world spanning data, analytics, indexing, block explorers, and more.

It was a great opportunity to network and discuss the future of blockchain data and more. Huge thanks to Noves and [growthepie](https://www.growthepie.xyz/) for being fantastic co-hosts, and to everyone who joined us.

After Devcon, the Envio team continued the momentum at [ZuThailand](https://www.zuthailand.com/), a one-month pop-up city experiment for 300+ deeply technical, curious, and self-driven builders. It was an exciting opportunity to engage with a vibrant community of innovators, share knowledge, and explore the future of decentralized technologies.
