Ahoy Developers!

We‚Äôre back with our third monthly community update, where we'll give you an exclusive view of what the Envio team has been shipping over the past month. As usual, we‚Äôll be covering upcoming events, technical developments, and exciting milestones. So, grab a cuppa, and let‚Äôs get technical! üíÉ

Our team has been doing some serious benchmarking tests to assess the syncing performance of various web3 indexing solutions. Builders want to move swiftly and iterate fast‚Ä¶and boy-o-boy is Envio F-A-S-T! Envio v0.0.20 ranked the fastest at indexing out of all the indexing solutions that we battle-tested. Our goal is to develop Envio as a top-tier performance blockchain indexing solution, validating this through rigorous data-driven approaches.

More details about the findings can be found [here](https://docs.envio.dev/blog/indexer-benchmarking-results).

The bounty game was strong this month! üí™

We released another three bounties with a total prize pool of a whopping **$1400 USDC** in our [Discord](https://www.notion.so/9d8e77645e7d4605a9d04c822aec5bba?pvs=21) that were quickly claimed by our builder community. These bounties included migrating the existing [Aave](https://aave.com/) V3 subgraph to an [Envio](https://envio.dev/) Indexer using our [Subgraph Migration Toolkit](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/subgraph-migration), an [ENS](https://ens.domains/) multi-chain indexer, and a [POAP](https://poap.xyz/) multi-chain indexer that indexes the POAP smart contracts. We‚Äôve seen some incredible milestones and received loads of valuable feedback. Big ups to all the builders who continue to inspire, participate, and help build Envio. üôè

Keep an eye out for more exciting bounties in the coming month of November. All Envio bounties are announced in our [bounties](https://discord.gg/Xuy3ub9Q28)üí∞announcement channel in Discord and on our [Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/envio) profile, so be sure to turn on those notifications.

### **Technical Overview üèóÔ∏è**

**Current release: üöÄ**

We‚Äôre thrilled to announce that we have released a new version of Envio, [v0.0.20](https://discord.gg/RyGRedQscR)!

**What's changed:**

- Handled BigDecimal from subgraph migration.
- Added error codes to input validation.
- Validated against using language-reserved keywords.
- Reduced default batch sizes.
- Added dynamic contracts to allow loading from all events.
- Improved ERC20 templates with approval entity.
- Handled dynamic contracts in raw events worker.
- Fixed raw events resync.
- Implemented hooks for stop worker.
- Fixed deferred breaking on an empty array.
- Implemented local scope in memory store - this makes the indexer less error-prone, and easier to test and reason about from a developer's point of view.
- Changed db functions to use quotes around table names for case consistency - allowing more diverse names for tables with capitalizations, etc.
- Refactor in memory store to have local state.
- Updated templates with a new layout for capitalization.
- Added Goerli testnet as an option for Hypersync - Goerli will be lightning-fast now.
- Template integration tests - fixed + included in the workflow.

- Update the casing of entities to allow users to choose casing.
- Integration testing using Matrix for test isolation - this means the starter templates will always be tested thoroughly before use.
- Added test to validate that multiple sync sources don‚Äôt break.
- Upgraded Ethers to Parse ABI files.
- Hypersync: Gnosis config.
- Event Sync State Table.
