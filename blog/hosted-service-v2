Starting **Wednesday, Nov 6th, 2024**, all new deployments will automatically utilize V2. Let’s see what you can expect!👇


## What’s New with V2?

Here’s what you can expect from the V2 Hosted Service:



* 10x faster build and deployment times 
* Faster indexing speeds
* Improved UI/UX

More features:

Behind-the-scenes enhancements: 



* Experience increased flexibility, improved reliability, and reduced costs.

*🚨Please note: From November 6th, 2024, all new indexer deployments will automatically route to the V2 Hosted Service instead of the current V1 Hosted Service. If you have existing indexers, any new pushes will deploy to V2 as well. *

You can explore your indexers in our new [Explorer](https://v2.envio.dev/explorer), while your V1 indexers will still be accessible at[ envio.dev](http://envio.dev).


## No Costs, Just Upgrades!

All developers will automatically be placed on our free development tier, so you won’t incur any costs during this transition. If you’d like to move to a production tier, please fill in[ this form](https://forms.gle/Enpyvpr1ZXze8A819).
