Envio's HyperSync supports over 70 EVM-compatible networks, along with  Fuel, providing reliable real-time data access, and we're just getting started. This milestone advances our goal of making decentralized data more efficient and accessible across the Web3 ecosystem. Our mission? To **MAKE DATA GREAT AGAIN** by helping developers and data analysts efficiently manage large data queries across multiple blockchains while ensuring reliable access to real-time data when you need it.


## What is HyperSync?

[HyperSync](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperSync/overview) is Envio's advanced data node, built in Rust to dramatically speed up blockchain data retrieval. It operates as a real-time, high-speed query layer, offering a low-level API compatible with Python, Rust, Node.js, and Go. With HyperSync, you can query millions of events in seconds—delivering sync speeds up to 2000x faster than traditional RPC methods. Yes, you read that right! 

Perfect for performance-heavy applications like block explorers, data analytics platforms, and blockchain bridges, HyperSync blends speed with flexibility. Traditional syncing methods can be slow and resource-intensive, especially across multiple networks. HyperSync optimizes these processes with intelligent caching and efficient data retrieval, giving you faster access to both real-time and historical blockchain data.


## Multi-chain Indexing Support

Envio's HyperIndex also provides multi-chain indexing support enabling you to efficiently index and query multiple blockchains with a single indexer. This eliminates redundant tools, streamlines workflows, and ensures high performance at scale. By simplifying cross-chain data access, Envio allows you to focus on building instead of managing complex infrastructure while maintaining seamless compatibility across networks.


## Supported Networks

Envio supports any EVM and Fuel with an expanding list of networks, including [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/), [Base](https://www.base.org/), [Blast](https://blast.io/en), [Celo](https://celo.org/), [Chiliz](https://www.chiliz.com/), [Citrea](https://citrea.xyz/), [Darwinia](https://darwinia.network/), [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), [Gnosis](https://www.gnosis.io/), [Metis](https://www.metis.io/), [Monad](https://www.monad.xyz/), [Morph](https://www.morphl2.io/), [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), [Rootstock](https://rootstock.io/), [Scroll](https://scroll.io/), the list goes on!  

See our full list of supported networks in our [documentation](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperSync/hypersync-supported-networks).

We are rapidly adding new supported networks. If you don't see your network listed or would like us to add HyperSync support for a network, pop us a message in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/gfZv3v3FsM).


## Why Envio?

Besides being the fastest blockchain indexer on the market (by miles), Envio's HyperIndex offers a developer-centric blockchain data indexing solution, empowering you to efficiently access and process both real-time and historical smart contract data served via query-rich GraphQL API supporting you with:



* **Flexible language support**: Configure your event handling in familiar and widely supported languages, such as JavaScript, TypeScript, or ReScript.

* **HyperSync**: To ensure blazing-fast retrieval of historical on-chain data and a seamless developer experience, Envio's HyperSync endpoint allows up to 1000x faster indexing than standard RPC (use of RPC is optional).

* **No-code Quickstart**: Autogenerate the key boilerplate for an entire Indexer project off single or multiple smart contracts. Deploy within minutes.

* **Multi-chain Support**: Aggregate data across multiple networks into a single database. Query all your data with a unified GraphQL API.

* **Factory Contracts**: Automatically register and process events emitted by all child contracts that are created by the specified factory / dynamic contract.

* **Hosted Service**: A managed service platform for building, hosting, and querying Envio's Indexers with guaranteed uptime and performance service level agreements.
