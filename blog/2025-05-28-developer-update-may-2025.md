<!--truncate-->

May was a big month at Envio.

We shipped major versions with powerful new features, which gave indexing performance a serious upgrade, and made the CLI even smoother for automation.

We also landed some exciting integrations, improved tooling across the board, locked in our DappCon 2025 sponsorship and speaking slot, and much more. Let‚Äôs dive in!

## Latest Releases: v2.19.0 ‚Üí v2.21.3

### **Fixed Invalid Rollback on Reorg Bug**

In v2.21.3, we addressed an issue with invalid rollbacks during reorgs. We highly recommend upgrading to this version to ensure smoother contract indexing and enhanced system stability.

#### **Async Contract Registration**

You can now register contracts asynchronously using external logic. Perfect for dynamic deployments where the contract address depends on an external source.

```
NftFactory.SimpleNftCreated.contractRegister(async ({ event, context }) => {
  const version = await getContractVersion(event.params.contractAddress);
  if (version === "v2") {
    context.addSimpleNftV2(event.params.contractAddress);
  } else {
    context.addSimpleNft(event.params.contractAddress);
  }
});
```

#### **New EVM Fields**

Added **<code>accessList</code>** and **<code>authorizationList</code>** (EIP-7702) to transactions for expanded chain compatibility.
#### **JSON Field Support in Schema**

You can now define flexible **<code>JSON</code>** fields in your GraphQL schema,  ideal for storing dynamic metadata.

```
type User {
  id: ID!
  metadata: Json!
}
```

#### **Effect API for Efficient External Calls**

The new Effect API lets you batch, memoize, and deduplicate external calls directly from your handlers.

Paired with loaders, it prevents overfetching and speeds up processing across large batches.

Check out the [walkthrough](https://www.loom.com/share/af44351d1a0a4d81882ea72e2c750c44) on Loom or dive into our [Loaders](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/loaders) guide to learn more.


#### **Contract Registration Boost**

Dynamic contract indexing is now dramatically faster. We‚Äôve deprecated `preRegisterDynamicContracts` option, it‚Äôs no longer needed.


#### **Improved RPC Error Handling**

We added support for 9 more RPC error types to improve retry logic and block range fallback.


#### **Non-Interactive CLI Setup**

You can now initialize an indexer entirely through the CLI, no prompts, ideal for scripting and automation.

This comes as part of early experimentation with Envio MCP.

## Envio Rolls Out Major Upgrade to Contract Indexing

Our latest performance upgrade unlocks dramatically faster dynamic indexing, especially for contracts deployed by factories. What previously took hours can now be done in minutes, with indexing speeds reaching nearly 30,000 events per second, even while dynamically registering new contracts.

No more two-pass preregistration flows. As of V2.19.0, contract registration happens in real-time, and the preregistration option has been deprecated. HyperIndex supports nested factory contracts, so if your contracts deploy other contracts (even more factories), we‚Äôll handle it automatically.

Big shoutout to one of our leading devs, [Dmitry Zakharov](https://x.com/dzakh_dev), for leading the work to streamline contract registration.

Here‚Äôs a look at the local dev console, a useful way to track indexing speed and progress in real time. In this example, it‚Äôs tearing through Uniswap V3 data.
