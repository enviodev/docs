<!--truncate-->

As part of Mission 4 from the [Monad Developers](https://discord.gg/monaddev) community, we challenged builders to create the most innovative real-time dashboards and visualizers on [Monad](https://www.monad.xyz/) using Envio. The results were exceptional. The developers delivered powerful tools that showcased not only creative visualizers and dashboards but also the power of Envio’s indexing stack.

Monad’s rapid growth has created a strong need for scalable, real-time data infrastructure. Whether tracking protocol activity, analyzing transaction flows, or building live analytics dashboards, a high-performance indexer is critical.

Envio is helping developers meet this demand with a robust suite of indexing tools that are purpose-built for high-throughput chains like Monad. These submissions highlight how Envio simplifies data indexing on Monad, enabling rich, real-time applications with speed, accuracy, and ease.

Let’s dive into some of the submissions built during Mission 4.
