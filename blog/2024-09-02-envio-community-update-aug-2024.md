Welcome to our August 2024 developer update! 

We‚Äôre excited to share the latest and greatest developments from the Envio team. In this edition, we‚Äôll highlight the launch of our latest V2 release, showcasing exciting new features and important fixes. We‚Äôll also cover key updates for August, including upcoming events, partnerships, and more. Let‚Äôs dive in!

## HyperSync Milestone ‚ö° 

<img src="/blog-assets/envio-developer-community-august-2024-1.png" alt="Cover Image HyperSync Requests" width="100%"/>

HyperSync requests have surpassed 10 billion requests, demonstrating [HyperSync](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperSync/overview) as a clear up-and-coming favourite for faster data indexing compared to RPC. As many of you know, Envio's indexer, [HyperIndex](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/overview), supports both RPC and/or HyperSync as a data source for ingesting blockchain data. 

The traditional approach to blockchain data retrieval uses RPC methods to extract data. This method, while functional, is far from efficient when querying lots of data. More info on this [here](https://docs.envio.dev/blog#the-blockchain-data-retrieval-challenge). 

## Version 2.2.0 now available üöÄ

We are excited to announce that the current release is **v.2.2.0**!

**What's changed?**

**Features**
- New Timestamp scalar type available in schema.graphql. It's represented as an instance of Date, making your handlers and queries more flexible, fast, and explicit.

**Fixes & Polishing**
- Updated Viem version to the latest V2 to fix type conflicts with the Viem version on user-side.
_‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful if you're using Viem V1 in your indexer handlers. This change might cause unexpected behavior._

- Fixed incorrect import of a type, which caused tsc --build to fail. Also, prevented this from happening in the future by adding a TypeScript type check to CI pipeline.
- Fixed codegen with HyperSync/RPC endpoint in the config having a trailing slash.
- Updated the supported chains list by adding new chains and removing deprecated ones.
- Removed dependency on Ethers.Interface.

**Other**
- Worked on Wildcard Indexing feature implementation.
- Worked on Fuel merge.
- Added script to help update the chain list.

## Transition to HyperIndex v2 Hosted Service ‚Äì Important Updates

With the launch of [HyperIndex](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/overview) v2, we're excited to share that the v2 [Hosted Service](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/hosted-service) is coming soon! Expect significant UI/UX improvements and enhancements to boost stability, reduce build times, and lower costs.

To facilitate this transition, we‚Äôre reducing the number of indexers on the v1 Hosted Service.

Specifically, we‚Äôll remove:

- Non-production deployments.
- Indexers older than one month with no recent endpoint requests.
- Indexers using outdated versions (v0.0.x and lower).

**üö®Action Required:**

- Promote any indexers you‚Äôre using to production status.
- Ensure your indexer version is >1.x or ideally v2. üòâ

For more details on the new pricing tiers, check our initial thoughts [here](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/hosted-service-billing). We appreciate your cooperation during this transition and look forward to what‚Äôs ahead! üöÄ

If you need to keep any specific indexers running, please reach out to us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/gfZv3v3FsM). Also, stay up-to-date with our latest version releases by following the ‚Äúüö®releases‚Äù [channel](https://discord.gg/uGVheTdmaH) in Discord for live updates as soon as new versions are available!

## Building ChainDensity

<img src="/blog-assets/envio-developer-community-august-2024-3.png" alt="Cover Image ETH Online Hackathon Banner" width="100%"/>

Understanding address activity in blockchain networks reveals the underlying dynamics of decentralized applications. [ChainDensity](https://chaindensity.xyz/) is a powerful tool designed to visualize event and transaction density across Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains.

By transforming raw data into clear visualizations, ChainDensity empowers developers and data analysts to uncover trends and optimize performance. It operates in two modes: **Event Density** and **Transaction Density**, allowing users to assess address activity over time effectively.
