Envio proudly partnered with Encode Club at the London 2025 hackathon, offering $3,000 in bounties for builders using [HyperIndex](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/overview) and [HyperSync](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperSync/overview). Over one weekend, developers explored how Envio’s fast blockchain indexing stack helps power real-time applications in Web3. 

The results spoke for themselves.


## Best use of HyperIndex ($1,000): VeriLoan

**Team:** Myo Myat

**GitHub:** [LuLuKar05/VeriLoan](https://github.com/LuLuKar05/VeriLoan)

**Demo:** [YouTube](https://youtu.be/3t525_GDlCM)

VeriLoan solves one of DeFi’s biggest problems, trust. It connects [Concordium](https://www.concordium.com)’s privacy preserving identity proofs with EVM wallets to enable verified borrower profiles. Using Envio HyperIndex, the team aggregated lending data from [Aave](https://aave.com), [Compound](https://compound.finance), and [Spark](https://spark.fi) to generate real-time DeFi credit reports. The project shows how Envio’s blockchain indexer can power private, compliant, and capital efficient lending systems built on trust rather than collateral.


## Best use of HyperSync ($1,000): Sniffer

**Team:** Abdul Aaqib Ali

**GitHub:** [Junaid2005/encode-hack-nov](https://github.com/Junaid2005/encode-hack-nov)

**Demo:** [YouTube](https://youtu.be/HXjyv-ngJis)

Sniffer uses Envio HyperSync and GPT 5 to make blockchain forensics conversational. Investigators can ask natural language questions and receive instant fraud reports with charts, alerts, and insights. HyperSync’s real-time data access, up to 2000 times faster than RPC, allows Sniffer to detect suspicious patterns almost immediately in real-time. It is a perfect example of how powerful blockchain indexing tools like Envio can bring AI and on-chain analytics together.


## Best use of HyperIndex Runner Up ($500): TradeTrackr

**Team:** Xferno GT

**GitHub:** [Cozkou/portfi](https://github.com/Cozkou/portfi)

**Demo:** [YouTube](https://youtu.be/uhtsKPt45oE)

TradeTrackr turns crypto trading into a social experience. Users can track their portfolios, join groups, and compete in trading leagues with real-time data indexed by Envio HyperIndex. Built with React, Tailwind, and shadcn UI, it supports Ethereum, Polygon, Base, and Arbitrum. The app uses Concordium for optional identity verification, creating fair competitions and trusted leaderboards. It shows how modern blockchain indexers like Envio make multichain analytics accessible for any Web3 project.


## Conclusion

From AI powered fraud detection to privacy aware lending and social trading apps, these teams proved that real-time data is the foundation of the next generation of decentralized applications.

Envio continues to push the boundaries of performance and reliability for developers who need a fast, scalable, and developer friendly Web3 indexer. Big thanks to the Encode team for having us, all the organizers and partners. Congratulations to all the winners and to every builder who participated.
