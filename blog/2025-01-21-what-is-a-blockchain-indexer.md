Blockchain technology is constantly reshaping how data is stored and shared, but accessing this data efficiently remains a significant challenge for developers. Building decentralized apps often involves navigating raw, unstructured blockchain data—a complex and time-consuming process. This is where blockchain indexers come in. They act as a crucial bridge, transforming scattered on-chain data into streamlined, actionable insights that simplify developing fast, efficient apps. In this blog, we'll dive into how blockchain indexers work, why they're essential, and why they've become the backbone of modern Web3 development.

## What is a Blockchain Indexer?

A blockchain indexer is a specialized tool designed to simplify the process of working with on-chain data. It organizes complex data into a structured, ready-to-use format, making it far easier for you to query and retrieve the exact data you need.

By defining data types and relationships based on your smart contracts, blockchain indexers like Envio automatically create a custom GraphQL API endpoint, allowing for efficient and precise queries. This means you can focus more on building your app's core functionality rather than wrangling with data.

Indexers also excel at optimizing performance, handling both real-time data retrieval and historical data access. What usually takes days or weeks with traditional methods can be completed in seconds, enabling you to build faster and be more productive.

## Why are Blockhain Indexers Important?

##### **1. Simplified Data Access**

Blockchain data is inherently scattered and sequential. For instance, fetching transaction logs might involve querying thousands of individual blocks. Indexers abstract this complexity, enabling you to retrieve filtered and aggregated data in seconds.

##### **2. Improved Developer Experience**

Without a blockchain indexer, you must handle data processing logic within your app—adding technical debt and slowing down development. Indexers remove this burden, allowing you to concentrate on providing better user experiences.

##### **3. Responsive Apps**

Blockchain indexers are optimized for low-latency queries, enabling access to real-time access and historical data. Whether your app requires real-time updates or rapid insights from past data, indexers are built to handle these demands efficiently.

**4. Multichain Support**

Many apps often interact with multiple networks, each with unique architectures. Indexers can simplify your data retrieval by providing a unified way to query, view, and interact with data across multiple chains.

**5. Customizability**

Blockchain indexers offer tailored solutions to meet your specific needs. You can define custom data schemas, filters, and indexing logic, ensuring the infrastructure aligns perfectly with your app's requirements.

**6. Hosted Service**

Operating an indexer infrastructure can be resource-intensive. [Hosted services](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/hosted-service) take this responsibility off your hands by offering a reliable fully managed, scalable solution. This allows you to focus on shipping your app without worrying about maintenance or downtime.

## What are the Key Components of a Blockchain Indexer?

A typical blockchain indexer setup includes the following components:

- **[config.yaml](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/configuration-file):** Defines the scope of indexing—including blockchain networks, smart contract addresses, start blocks, events, and more.

- **[schema.graphql](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/schema):** The GraphQL schema file (e.g., schema.graphql) defines the structure of your data and how it's stored. Based on this schema, a custom GraphQL API is autogenerated, enabling efficient queries for the indexed data.

- **[Event handlers](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/event-handlers)**: Detects specific on-chain events and updates the indexed data accordingly, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

## How does Blockchain Indexing Work?

At its core, the indexing process begins with the indexer connecting to a network/s and monitoring new blocks as they are added to the chain. The indexer then extracts specific event data and organizes it in a structured database.

Instead of forcing you to comb through each block manually, the indexer uses predefined configurations to filter and store the data most relevant to your needs. This structured data can then be queried efficiently using GraphQL APIs.

## Best examples of Blockchain Indexers

### Uniswap V4

This [Uniswap V4 indexer](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/example-uniswap-v4-multi-chain-indexer) showcases a TypeScript-based, multichain indexer for Uniswap V4 across 10 different networks. This is the same indexer that powers the [v4.xyz](https://v4.xyz) website.

### Aerodrome

This [Aerodrome indexer](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/example-aerodrome-dex-indexer) example provides a TypeScript-based, multichain indexer for the [Aerodrome](https://aerodrome.finance/) and [Velodrome](https://velodrome.finance/) DEXs using Envio HyperIndex. The indexer supports smart contract deployments on [Base](https://www.base.org/), [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), [Mode](https://www.mode.network/), and [Lisk](https://lisk.com/), with data available through a unified GraphQL API.

### Sablier

This [Sablier indexer](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/example-sablier) example includes a TypeScript-based, multichain indexer for the [Sablier](https://sablier.com/) protocol using Envio HyperIndex, indexing data across 18 EVM chains. Data is accessible through a unified GraphQL API.

## Exploring Envio as a Blockchain Indexer

Envio's blockchain indexing solution is built to support both the Fuel Network and any EVM-compatible blockchain, offering developers a versatile and adaptable choice offering:

- **Flexible language support**: Configure your event handling in familiar and widely supported languages, such as JavaScript, TypeScript, or ReScript.

- **HyperSync**: To ensure blazing-fast retrieval of historical on-chain data and a seamless developer experience, Envio's [HyperSync](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperSync/overview) endpoint allows up to 1000x faster indexing than standard RPC (use of RPC is optional).

- **No-code Quickstart**: Autogenerate the key boilerplate for an entire Indexer project off single or multiple smart contracts. Deploy within minutes.

- **Multichain Support**: Aggregate data across multiple networks into a single database. Query all your data with a unified GraphQL API.
