<!--truncate-->

March was madness! We‚Äôre excited to roll out HyperIndex v2.15.0 with RPC failover support, LogTui for fast chain scans, and integrations with V12, XDC Network, Monad, and Chiliz. With new tools, powerful partnerships, tutorials, and more, we‚Äôre empowering developers to build smarter and faster than ever. Let‚Äôs dive into the latest updates!


## üöÄ HyperIndex Versions 2.14.0 & 2.15.0 is now available üöÄ

### Topic Filtering goes Multichain ‚õìÔ∏è
Now the `eventFilters` option can also accept a callback, allowing for building different filters depending on `chainId`:

```
import { ERC20 } from "generated";

const ZERO_ADDRESS = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000";

const WHITELISTED_ADDRESSES = {
  1: [
    "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266",
    "0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8",
  ],
  100: ["0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC"],
};

ERC20.Transfer.handler(
  async ({ event, context }) => {
    //... your handler logic
  },
  {
    wildcard: true,
    eventFilters: ({ chainId }) => [
      { from: ZERO_ADDRESS, to: WHITELISTED_ADDRESSES[chainId] },
      { from: WHITELISTED_ADDRESSES[chainId], to: ZERO_ADDRESS },
    ],
  }
);
```
### Stricter `chainId` type üîê
The `chainId` type on `event` is now a union of chain ids the event belongs to. This is much safer than a number type used before.


### RPC as a fallback
HyperIndex v2.14.1 also went live with this update bringing enhanced reliability with RPC failover support‚Äîensuring 100% uptime for your indexer. If HyperSync becomes unavailable, your indexer will automatically switch to an RPC provider.


#### What's new?


* **RPC as a fallback** ‚Üí If the primary data source doesn‚Äôt receive a new block in 20 seconds, your indexer seamlessly switches to an RPC provider.
* **New RPC configuration syntax** ‚Üí Easily add redundancy with a single field.
* **Advanced control** ‚Üí Define multiple RPC endpoints, set fallback priorities, and customize block intervals.



#### How to enable it?

Simply add an RPC field to your network configuration:



* If HyperSync is available for a chain, it remains the primary data source, with RPC as a fallback.

For chains without HyperSync support, RPC becomes the primary data source.


```
networks:
  - id: 137 # Polygon
    start_block: 0
+   rpc: https://eth-mainnet.your-rpc-provider.com
    contracts:
      - name: PolygonGreeter
        address: 0x9D02A17dE4E68545d3a58D3a20BbBE0399E05c9c
```


**Advanced RPC Configuration:**

Want more control? You got it. Now you can explicitly define primary vs. fallback RPC providers:


```
networks:
  - id: 137 # Polygon
    start_block: 0
+   rpc:
+     url: https://eth-mainnet.your-rpc-provider.com
+     for: sync
    contracts:
      - name: PolygonGreeter
        address: 0x9D02A17dE4E68545d3a58D3a20BbBE0399E05c9c
```


Or specify multiple RPC endpoints with custom settings:


```
networks:
  - id: 137 # Polygon
    start_block: 0
+   rpc:
+     - url: https://eth-mainnet.your-rpc-provider.com?API_KEY={ENVIO_MAINNET_API_KEY}
+       for: fallback
+     - url: https://eth-mainnet.your-free-rpc-provider.com
+       for: fallback
+       initial_block_interval: 1000
    contracts:
      - name: PolygonGreeter
        address: 0x9D02A17dE4E68545d3a58D3a20BbBE0399E05c9c
```


This update ensures full redundancy, uninterrupted indexing, and complete flexibility.

This month, we‚Äôre thrilled to feature Gabriel Stoica, a passionate developer focused on decentralization, privacy, and bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3. With years of experience crafting smart contracts and building end-to-end dApps, Gabriel has dedicated his work to making Web3 more accessible for all.

Currently leading the development of [Werk](https://www.werk.pro/), a Web3 platform that enables freelancers and entrepreneurs to bring their daily activities on-chain, Gabriel has a knack for designing seamless blockchain integrations. He‚Äôs also built tools to help non-crypto natives interact with blockchain technology, especially in the ReFi/DeFi space.


***"I first heard about Envio on social media and was curious whether its impressive speed would truly be felt throughout the entire development process‚Äîfrom setting up an indexer to configuring and deploying it. Like any modern product, Envio wasn‚Äôt perfect. I ran into a limitation and decided to reach out on Discord. What surprised me most wasn‚Äôt just their responsiveness, but the level of openness and genuine collaboration they brought to the table. Their professionalism is matched by their approachability, making the experience seamless and engaging. At its core, Envio is built on rapid iteration and continuous improvement while staying deeply attuned to its users' needs. I‚Äôd highly recommend Envio as the go-to indexer for any crypto project looking to combine speed, efficiency, and top-tier support."*** *- Gabriel Stoica, Lead Developer at Werk*
