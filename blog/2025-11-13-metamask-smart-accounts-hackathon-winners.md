# MetaMask Smart Accounts x Monad x Envio Hackathon: Envio Winners

Envio joined [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/en-GB/developer) Developers and [Monad](https://www.monad.xyz) for the MetaMask Smart Accounts Dev Cook-Off, a global hackathon focused on the next generation of wallet and smart account experiences. Over three weeks, builders explored account abstraction, modular execution, AI driven automation, and real-time blockchain data indexing using Envio.

The projects below stood out across innovation, execution quality, and use of Envio’s indexing stack. Let’s take a look at our winners.

## Best use of Envio ($2,000): Last Monad

Last Monad built a live network dashboard that showcases activity across Monad in real-time. Using Envio to index contract events with high speed and accuracy, the team delivered an always up to date view of the chain.

The project shows how real-time blockchain indexers like Envio unlock transparent analytics for high performance networks, giving developers a clear way to explore and understand on-chain behaviour as it happens.

## Best Onchain Automation ($1,000): TradeClub

TradeClub introduced automated on-chain execution powered by smart accounts. The project used Envio to index their data to power intent based triggers and automated flows, allowing users to run actions without managing complex backend logic.

It highlights how real-time data from Envio’s blockchain indexing solution can support consumer friendly automation and smarter on-chain behaviour.

## Best AI Agent ($1,000): ShieldAI

ShieldAI built an on-chain monitoring agent that reacts to blockchain events on Monad in real-time. With Envio providing reliable, indexed data, the agent could track contract interactions, detect anomalies, and surface insights efficiently.

It shows how AI agents become significantly more powerful when they can rely on clean, real-time blockchain data from indexing solutions like Envio.

## Best Consumer App ($1,000): Smart Account Explorer

Smart Account Explorer created a clear interface for viewing and understanding smart account activity. With Envio’s real-time blockchain indexing layer handling the heavy lifting, the app delivered fast lookups of permissions, transactions, and account behaviour without any lag. It made smart accounts feel accessible and transparent for everyday users.

The project shows how consumer apps can improve usability by pairing smart accounts with fast, structured on-chain data from indexing solutions like Envio.
 
## Conclusion

The MetaMask Smart Accounts x Monad Dev Cook Off highlighted what happens when wallet innovation meets real-time data performance. From onboarding to gaming and DeFi UX, each project showed what’s possible when you mix smart accounts and efficient blockchain tools like Envio.

Envio’s multichain blockchain indexer remains a cornerstone for teams indexing Monad data. Developers can use it to access efficient, real-time data on Monad and any other EVM chain. It gives them a simple way to query and understand Monad activity in real-time without dealing with the overhead of running or scaling their own indexing infrastructure.
