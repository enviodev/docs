# HyperRPC: Ultra-Fast Read-Only Blockchain Access

HyperRPC is an extremely fast read-only RPC designed specifically for data-intensive blockchain tasks. Built from the ground up to optimize performance, it offers a simple drop-in solution with dramatic speed improvements over traditional nodes.

## What is HyperRPC?

HyperRPC is a specialized JSON-RPC endpoint that focuses exclusively on **read operations** to deliver exceptional performance. By optimizing specifically for data retrieval workflows, HyperRPC can significantly outperform traditional nodes for data-intensive applications.

Key characteristics:

- **Read-only**: Optimized for data retrieval (cannot send transactions)
- **Drop-in compatible**: Works with existing tooling that uses standard RPC methods
- **Specialized**: Designed specifically for data-intensive operations like `eth_getLogs`

## Performance Advantages

Early benchmarks show that HyperRPC can deliver up to **5x performance improvement** for data-intensive operations compared to traditional nodes like `geth`, `erigon`, and `reth`.

This performance boost is particularly noticeable for:

- Historical data queries
- Log event filtering
- Block and transaction retrievals
- Analytics applications

## Supported Methods

HyperRPC currently supports the following Ethereum JSON-RPC methods:

| Category             | Methods                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chain Data**       | `eth_chainId`<br />`eth_blockNumber`                                                                                                      |
| **Block Data**       | `eth_getBlockByNumber`<br />`eth_getBlockByHash`<br />`eth_getBlockReceipts`                                                              |
| **Transaction Data** | `eth_getTransactionByHash`<br />`eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex`<br />`eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex`<br />`eth_getTransactionReceipt` |
| **Event Logs**       | `eth_getLogs`                                                                                                                             |
| **Traces**           | `trace_block` (only on [select chains](./hyperrpc-supported-networks))                                                                    |

## Supported Networks

HyperRPC is available across numerous EVM-compatible networks. For the most up-to-date list of supported chains, please see our [Supported Networks](./hyperrpc-supported-networks) page.

## Getting Started

To start using HyperRPC:

1. **Get Access**:

   - Visit our [Supported Networks](./hyperrpc-supported-networks) page to find all available HyperRPC endpoints
   - Each network has a ready-to-use URL that you can start using immediately

2. **Use Like a Standard RPC**:

   ```javascript
   // Example: Fetching logs with HyperRPC
   const response = await fetch("https://eth.rpc.hypersync.xyz", {
     method: "POST",
     headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       jsonrpc: "2.0",
       id: 1,
       method: "eth_getLogs",
       params: [
         {
           fromBlock: "0x1000000",
           toBlock: "0x1000100",
           address: "0xYourContractAddress",
         },
       ],
     }),
   });
   ```

3. **Provide Feedback**:
