There are high-performance clients for JavaScript/TypeScript (NodeJS only for now), Python, and Rust now. Please get in touch if there are features that you would appreciate, for example, if you require a browser-based javascript client, additional data, or even usage in another language.

The clients use a common rust base for high performance and uniform experience across different languages. All clients use our optimized binary transport and purpose-built API for maximum efficiency.
