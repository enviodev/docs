# HyperSync Query

This page explains how the HyperSync query works and how to get the data you need from HyperSync.

:::note
Not all of the features that are implemented in HyperSync are implemented in HyperFuel (Fuel implementation of HyperSync). For example stream and collect functions aren't implemented on the Fuel client as of writing.

## Introduction

This section gives a brief introduction using a simple query example.

Below is an example query that gets some logs and transactions related to a contract at address `0x3f69bb14860f7f3348ac8a5f0d445322143f7fee`.

We will explain the exact semantics of the query in next sections but can just go over the basics here for an introduction.

`logs` is the list of `LogSelection`s we want to pass. The server return all logs that match <b>any</b> of our selections.

Also the transactions for the logs that our query matches will be returned. This is because transactions are joined after querying logs implicitly in HyperSync query implementation. Blocks are also joined after transactions but we won't get any blocks because we didn't select any block fields in our `field_selection`.

`field_selection` is for selecting the specific fields we want returned. You can think of it like the part where you list column names in an SQL `SELECT` statement. The available tables are `log`, `transaction`, `block` and `trace`. We will give an exact list of available columns in later sections.

We also have a `max_num_logs` parameter here which means the query execution will stop as soon as the server realizes it reached or exceeded ten logs in the response. So this is not an exact limit, but it can be effective when trying to fine tune the query response size or runtime.

If you want to drive this query until the end of the blockchain height or if you want to build a full data pipeline, it is recommended to use the `collect` and `stream` functions that are implemented in the client libraries.

<b>TIP</b>: set `RUST_LOG` environment variable to `trace` if you want to see more logs when using the client libraries.

	"from_block": 0,

		{

			]

			"gas_used",
			"type",
			"block_number"
		]
	},
	"max_num_logs": 10
}
```

## Query Execution Explained

This section explains how the query executes on the server, step-by-step.

#### Preliminary

The data in HyperSync server is split into groups by block number. Each groups consists of data for a
 contiguous block range. When the query runs, these groups are always queried atomically, meaning if a group
 is queried it is never queried in half. This is important when considering limit arguments like `max_num_logs`
 or when considering time/response_size limits. If server realzes it reached a limit then it will terminate the
 query after it finishes the current data group it is querying and then return the response to the user. On the
 response it will put `next_block` value which is the block the query stopped at. 

#### Query limits

- <b>Time</b>: There is a server-configured time limit that applies to all queries. This limit can be exceeded slightly by the server, the reason is explained in the preliminary above.
- <b>Response size</b>: There is a server-configured response size limit that applies to all queries. But the user can also set a lower response size limit in their query via max_num_* parameters. This limit can be exceeded slightly by the server, the reason is explained in the preliminary above.
- <b>to_block</b>: This can be set by the user in query. The number is exclusive so the query will go up-to `to_block` but won't include data from this block. This limit won't be exceeded by the server so the query always will stop at this block number and will not include data from this block number or the later blocks. Also the next_block will be equal to this block number if none of the other limits triggered before server reached this block number.

#### Steps

- Server receives the query and checks which block the query starts at.
- It finds the data group it should start from.
- It iterates through the data groups using the query until it hits some limit
- When a limit is hit, the response is serialised and sent back to the client.

## Query Fields

In this section, we show the explanation of each field in the query. We give the content in `rust` style for
 formatting purposes. Field name casing can change based on which language client you are using, e.g. camelCase for nodejs client

```rust

    ///  end of data. Exclusive, the returned range will be [from_block..to_block).
    ///
    /// The query will return before it reaches this target block if it hits the time limit
    ///  configured on the server. The user should continue their query by putting the
    ///  next_block field in the response into from_block field of their next query. This implements

## Stream and Collect Functions

This section explains how the `stream` and `collect` functions work on the client libraries. These functions run the query multiple times internally so they can be harder to understand compared to how a single query works.

<b>Disclaimer</b>: These functions are not designed to be used in a rollback context, if you are at the tip of the chain we recommend implementing a loop using one of the `get` functions from the client library you are using and handling the rollbacks manually.

#### Stream

Stream function runs many internal queries concurrently and gives back the results as they come. It returns a stream handle that can be used to receive the results. It pipelines decoding/decompressing etc. of response chunks so user can get a very efficient experience out of the box. It will stream data until it reaches query.to_block or if to_block was not speicified in the query, it runs until it reaches chain height at the time of the stream start (it gets height of chain when it is starting the stream and runs until it reaches it).

<b>WARNING</b>: If you are opening/closing many streams in your program, it is recommended to explicitly call `close` function on the stream handle so there is no resource leakage.

#### Collect

The collect function essentially calls `stream` internally and collects all of the data into a single response. The `collect_parquet` function can be used to pipe data into a parquet file, it doesn't accumulate all data in memory so can be used to collect data that doesn't fit in RAM. We still recommend chunking the `collect_parquet` calls so you don't end up with big parquet files.

<b>TIP</b>: set `RUST_LOG` environment variable to `trace` if you want to see more logs when using the client libraries.

## Join Modes

<b>NOTE</b>: The word join does not mean the same as in `SQL` in this context. It means the inclusion of relevant data in the response instead of left/outer joining or similar in `SQL`. You can think of it like you do a select on table `A` and then join in table `B`. In sql this would mean each row contains rows from `A` and `B`. But in HyperSync this means you get data for `A` and `B` seperately and the rows you get from `A` mean you will get the joined in rows from `B` as well in the response. 

In the context of HyperSync, joins refer to the implicit linking of different types of blockchain data (logs, transactions, traces, and blocks) based on certain relationships. Here's an explanation of how these joins work:

### Default Join Mechanism

`logs` -> `transactions` -> `traces` -> `blocks`

1. **Logs to Transactions**:
   - When you query logs using `log_selection`, HyperSync automatically retrieves the transactions associated with those logs. This is based on the transaction hash present in each log.
     - Example: If your `log_selection` returns some logs, HyperSync includes the transactions that generated these logs in the response as well.

2. **Transactions to Traces**:
   - After fetching the relevant transactions (either directly through `transaction_selection` or via logs), HyperSync retrieves the associated traces.
     - Example: If your `transaction_selection` returns transactions or if you get some transactions because of your `log_selection`, HyperSync includes traces related to these transactions in the response as well.

And this same scheme goes on from traces into blocks as well. We realize this doesn't cover all use cases. For example the user can't get logs based on their transaction_selection this way. This is why we implemented alternative `join_mode` implementations.

### Alternative Join Modes 

1. **JoinAll**:

   This mode first builds up a list of transactions based on selection of every table. For example the list will include a transaction if your `log_selection` selected a log generated by this transaction.

   Then it includes every object relating to any of these transactions on the list. For example it includes all traces that were generated by any of these transactions on the list.

   For example let's say you selected a trace. It will include the transaction that generated this trace. And then it will include everything related to this transaction including all the logs, traces, the block and the transaction itself.

3. **JoinNothing**:
   This mode completely removes joining so you only get what your selections match. For example if your `log_selection` matches a log then you will only get that log, you will not get the block of the log or the transaction that generated that log.

To use these join modes set `query.join_mode` to the desired value. It defaults to the `Default` mode if it is not specified.
