# API Tokens for HyperSync

## Overview

API tokens provide authenticated access to HyperSync services, enabling enhanced capabilities and usage tracking. While currently optional, they will become mandatory in the future and offer significant advantages for serious usage.

**Starting from 9 April 2025**, you will still be able to use HyperSync without API tokens, but **rate limits will be applied**. The service will remain **free to use until the end of April**. From **May onwards**, we will introduce a set of **tiered packages based on usage**. Indexers deployed to our hosted service will have special access to HyperSync that does not require a custom API token.

## Benefits of Using API Tokens

Using API tokens with HyperSync provides several advantages:

- **Dedicated Resources**: Access to reserved capacity and bandwidth
- **Performance Guarantees**: Higher quality of service with better reliability
- **Usage Analytics**: Track and monitor your consumption patterns
- **Future-Proofing**: Early adoption before tokens become mandatory
- **Enhanced Support**: Better visibility for troubleshooting assistance

## Generating API Tokens

You can generate API tokens through the Envio Dashboard:

1. Visit [https://envio.dev/app/api-tokens](https://envio.dev/app/api-tokens)
2. Sign in to your account (or create one if you don't have one)
3. Follow the prompts to create a new token
4. Copy and securely store your token

## Implementation Guide

To use an API token, pass it as a `bearer_token` when creating a HyperSync client:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript/JavaScript">

```typescript
const client = HypersyncClient.new({
  url: "https://eth.hypersync.xyz",
  bearerToken: process.env.HYPERSYNC_BEARER_TOKEN,
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
client = hypersync.HypersyncClient(hypersync.ClientConfig(
    url="https://eth.hypersync.xyz",
    bearer_token=os.environ.get("HYPERSYNC_BEARER_TOKEN")
))
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

```rust
let client = Client::new(ClientConfig {
    bearer_token: Some(std::env::var("HYPERSYNC_BEARER_TOKEN").unwrap_or_default()),
    ..Default::default()
})
.unwrap();
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Understanding Usage

To understand your current month's usage, visit [https://envio.dev/app/api-tokens](https://envio.dev/app/api-tokens). Usage is composed of two main components:

- **Number of Requests**: The total count of API requests made.
- **Credits**: A comprehensive calculation that takes into account multiple factors including data bandwidth, disk read operations, and other resource utilization metrics. This provides the most accurate representation of actual service usage. We're happy to provide more detailed breakdowns of the credit calculation upon request.

## Security Best Practices

When working with API tokens:

- **Never commit tokens to git repositories**
- **Use environment variables** to store tokens instead of hardcoding
- **Add token files like `.env` to your `.gitignore**
- **Rotate tokens periodically** for enhanced security
- **Limit token sharing** to only those who require access

```bash
# Example .env file
HYPERSYNC_BEARER_TOKEN=your_secret_token_here
```

This approach keeps your tokens secure while making them available to your application at runtime.
