## Envio Hosted Service Overview

**File:** `hosted-service.md`

Envio offers a fully managed hosting solution for your indexers, providing all the infrastructure, scaling, and monitoring needed to run production-grade indexers without operational overhead.

Our hosted service offers multiple tiers to suit different needs, from free development environments to enterprise-grade dedicated hosting. Each tier includes powerful features like static production endpoints, built-in alerts, and production-ready infrastructure. 

### Deployment Options

Envio provides flexibility in how you deploy and host your indexers:

- **Fully Managed Hosted Service**: Let Envio handle everything. The following sections of this page outline the Fully Managed Hosted Service in more detail. This is the recommend deployment method for most users and removes the hosting overhead for your team. See below for the all the awesome features we provide and see the Pricing & Billing page for more information on which Hosting tier suits your indexing needs.

- **Self-Hosting**: Run your indexer on your own infrastructure. This requires advanced setup and infrastructure knowledged not unique to Envio. See the repository at https://github.com/enviodev/local-docker-example for a simple docker example to get you started. Please note this example does not cover all infrastructure related needs. It is recommended that at least a separate Postgres management tool is used for self hosting in production.

### Hosted Service Key Features

- **Git-based Deployments**: Similar to Vercel, deploy your indexer by simply pushing to a designated deployment branch
- **Zero Infrastructure Management**: We handle all the servers, databases, and scaling for you
- **Static Production Endpoints**: Consistent URLs with zero-downtime deployments and instant version switching
- **Built-in Monitoring**: Track logs, sync status, and deployment health in real-time
- **Comprehensive Alerting**: Multi-channel notifications (Discord, Slack, Telegram, Email) for critical issues, performance warnings, and deployment updates
- **Security Features**: IP/Domain whitelisting to control access to your indexer endpoints
- **GraphQL API**: Access your indexed data through a performant, production-ready GraphQL endpoint
- **Multi-chain Support**: Deploy indexers that track multiple networks from a single codebase

### Hosted Service Deployment Model

The Envio Hosted Service provides a seamless GitHub-integrated deployment workflow:

1. **GitHub Integration**: Install the Envio Deployments GitHub App to connect your repositories
2. **Flexible Configuration**: Support for monorepos with configurable root directories, config file locations, and deployment branches
3. **Automatic Deployments**: Push to your deployment branch to trigger builds and deployments
4. **Version Management**: Maintain multiple deployment versions with one-click switching and rollback capabilities
5. **Real-time Monitoring**: Track deployment progress, logs, and sync status through the dashboard

**Multiple Indexers**: Deploy several indexers from a single repository using different configurations, branches, or directories.

You can view and manage your hosted indexers in the Envio Explorer at https://envio.dev/explorer.

### Important Notes

It is recommended that before deploying to the Hosted Service, the indexer is built and tested locally to ensure it runs smoothly on the Hosted Service.

## Hosted Service Features

**File:** `hosted-service-features.md`

Our hosted service includes several production-ready features to help you manage and secure your indexer deployments.

### Plan Availability Notice

Most features listed in this section are available for **paid production plans only**. The free development tier has limited features and is designed for testing and development purposes.

### Development Tier Disclaimer

The free development tier is intended for testing and development purposes only and should not be used as a production environment. Envio makes no guarantees regarding uptime, availability, or data persistence for deployments on the development tier. If you choose to use a development tier deployment in a production capacity, you do so entirely at your own risk. Envio assumes no liability or accountability for any downtime, data loss, or service interruptions that may occur on development tier deployments.

### IP/Domain Whitelisting

**Status**: Coming Soon - Full support for whitelisting is in active development

## Deploying Your Indexer

**File:** `hosted-service-deployment.md`

The Envio Hosted Service provides a seamless git-based deployment workflow, similar to modern platforms like Vercel. This enables you to easily deploy, update, and manage your indexers through your normal development workflow.

### Prerequisites & Important Information

#### Requirements

- **Version Support**: Deployment on the Hosted Service requires at least version `2.6.0`. Additionally the following versions are not supported: 
  - `2.29.x`
- **PNPM Support**: deployment must be compatible with pnpm version `9.10.0`
- **Package.json**: the `package.json` file must be present and include the above two requirements.
- **Configuration file**: a HyperIndex configuration file must be present (the name can be set in the indexer settings)
- **Github Repository**: The repository must be no larger than `100MB`

Before deploying your indexer, please be aware of the following limits and policies:

#### Deployment Limits
- **3 development tier indexers** per organization
- **Deployments per indexer**: 3 deployments per indexer
- Deployments can be deleted in the hosted service to make space for more deployments

#### Development Tier Fair Usage Policy

The free development tier includes automatic deletion policies to ensure fair resource allocation:

**Automatic Deletion Rules:**
- **Hard Limits**: 
  - Deployments that exceed 20GB of storage will be automatically deleted
  - Deployments older than 30 days will be automatically deleted
- **Soft Limits** (whichever comes first): 
  - 100,000 events processed
  - 5GB storage used 
  - no requests for 7 days 

**When soft limits are breached, the two-stage deletion process begins**

**Two-Stage Deletion Process:**

_Applies to development deployments that breach the soft limits_

1. **Grace Period (7 days)** - Your indexer continues to function normally, you receive notification about the upcoming deletion
2. **Read-Only Access (3 days)** - Indexer stops processing new data, existing data remains accessible for queries  
3. **Full Deletion** - Indexer and all data are permanently deleted

**Note**: The grace period durations (7 + 3 days) are subject to change. Always monitor your deployment status and upgrade when approaching limits.

### Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

#### Initial Setup

1. **Log in with GitHub**: Visit https://envio.dev/app/login and authenticate with your GitHub account
2. **Select an Organization**: Choose your personal account or any organization you have access to
3. **Install the Envio Deployments GitHub App**: Grant access to the repositories you want to deploy

#### Configure Your Indexer

4. **Add a New Indexer**: Click "Add Indexer" in the dashboard
5. **Connect to Repository**: Select the repository containing your indexer code
6. **Configure Deployment Settings**:
   - Specify the config file location
   - Set the root directory (important for monorepos)
   - Choose the deployment branch

**Note**: You can deploy multiple indexers from a single repository by configuring them with different config file paths, root directories, and/or deployment branches.

**Monorepo Warning**: If you're working in a monorepo, ensure all your imports are contained within your indexer directory to avoid deployment issues.

#### Deploy Your Code

7. **Create a Deployment Branch**: Set up the branch you specified during configuration
8. **Deploy via Git**: Push your code to the deployment branch
9. **Monitor Deployment**: Track the progress of your deployment in the Envio dashboard

#### Manage Your Deployment

10. **Version Management**: Once deployed, you can:
    - View detailed logs
    - Switch between different deployed versions
    - Rollback to previous versions if needed

### Continuous Deployment Best Practices

For a robust deployment workflow, we recommend:

1. **Protected Branches**: Set up branch protection rules for your deployment branch
2. **Pull Request Workflow**: Instead of pushing directly to the deployment branch, use pull requests from feature branches
3. **CI Integration**: Add tests to your CI pipeline to validate indexer functionality before merging to the deployment branch

### Continuous Configuration 

After deploying your indexer, you can manage its configuration through several tabs in the Envio dashboard:

#### General Tab

The General tab provides core configuration options:

- **Config File Path**: Update the location of your indexer's configuration file
- **Deployment Branch**: Change which Git branch triggers deployments
- **Root Directory**: Modify the root directory for your indexer (useful for monorepos)
- **Delete Indexer**: Permanently remove the indexer and all its deployments

**Warning**: Deleting an indexer is permanent and will remove all associated deployments and data. This action cannot be undone.

#### Environment Variables Tab

Configure environment-specific variables for your indexer:

- Add custom environment variables with the `ENVIO_` prefix
- Environment variables are securely stored and injected into your indexer at runtime
- Useful for API keys, configuration values, and other deployment-specific settings

**Best Practice**: Use environment variables for sensitive data rather than hardcoding values in your repository. Remember to prefix all variables with `ENVIO_`.

#### Plans & Billing Tab

Manage your indexer's pricing tier and billing:

- Select from available pricing plans
- Upgrade your plan to suit your needs
- View current plan features and limits

#### Alerts Tab

Configure monitoring and notification preferences:

- Set up notification channels (Discord, Slack, Telegram, Email)
- Choose which alert types to receive (Production Endpoint Down, Indexer Stopped Processing, etc.)
- Configure deployment notifications (Historical Sync Complete)

**Note**: Alert configuration is available for indexers deployed with version 2.24.0 or higher on paid production plans.

## Monitoring Your Indexer

**File:** `hosted-service-monitoring.md`

Once your indexer is deployed, the Envio Hosted Service provides several tools to help you monitor its health, performance, and progress.

### Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard provides real-time visibility into your indexer's status:

**Key Metrics Displayed:**
- **Active Deployments**: Track how many deployments are currently running (e.g., 1/3 active)
- **Deployment Status**: See whether your indexer is actively syncing, stopped, or has encountered errors
- **Recent Commits**: View your deployment history with commit information and active status
- **Usage Statistics**: Monitor your indexing hours, storage usage, and query rate limits
- **Network Progress**: Real-time progress bars showing sync status for each blockchain network
- **Events Processed**: Track the total number of events your indexer has processed
- **Historical Sync Time**: See how long it took to complete the initial sync

### Deployment Status Indicators

Each deployment shows clear status information:
- **Syncing**: Indexer is actively processing blocks and events
- **Syncing Stopped**: Indexer has stopped processing (may indicate an error or a breach of tier limits)
- **Historical Sync Complete**: Initial sync finished, indexer is processing new blocks in real-time

### Error Detection and Troubleshooting

When issues occur, the dashboard displays failure information to help you quickly diagnose problems.

**Failure Information Includes:**
- **Error Type**: Clear indication of the failure (e.g., "Indexing Has Stopped")
- **Error Description**: Details about what went wrong (e.g., "Error during event handling")
- **Next Steps**: Guidance on where to find more information (error logs)
- **Support Access**: Direct link to Discord for assistance

### Logging

Full logging support is integrated and configured by Envio via the Hosted Service.

Access detailed logs to troubleshoot issues and monitor indexer behavior:

- **Real-time Logs**: View live logs as your indexer processes events

## Self-Hosting Your Envio Indexer

**File:** `self-hosting.md`

While Envio offers a fully managed Hosted Service, you may prefer to run your indexer on your own infrastructure. This guide covers everything you need to know about self-hosting Envio indexers.

**Note**: This documentation page is actively being improved. Check back regularly for updates and additional information.

**Appreciation Note**: We deeply appreciate users who choose our hosted service, as it directly supports our team and helps us continue developing and improving Envio's technology. If your use case allows for it, please consider the hosted option.

### Why Self-Host?

Self-hosting gives you:

- **Complete Control**: Manage your own infrastructure and configurations
- **Data Sovereignty**: Keep all indexed data within your own systems

**Disclaimer**: Self Hosting can be done on with a variety of different infrastructures, tools and methods. The outline below is merely a starting point and does not offer a full production level solution. In some cases advanced knowledge of infrastructure, database management and networking may be required for a full production level solution.

### Prerequisites

Before self-hosting, ensure you have:

- Docker installed on your host machine
- Sufficient storage for blockchain data and the indexer database
- Adequate CPU and memory resources (requirements vary based on chains and indexing complexity)
- Required HyperSync and/or RPC endpoints
- Envio API token for HyperSync access (`ENVIO_API_TOKEN`) — required for continued access

### Getting Started

In general, if you want to self-host, you will likely use a Docker setup.
For a working example, check out the local-docker-example repository at https://github.com/enviodev/local-docker-example.
It contains a minimal `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` that configure the Envio indexer together with PostgreSQL and Hasura.

### Configuration Explained

The compose file in that repository sets up three main services:

1. **PostgreSQL Database** (`envio-postgres`): Stores your indexed data
2. **Hasura GraphQL Engine** (`graphql-engine`): Provides the GraphQL API for querying your data
3. **Envio Indexer** (`envio-indexer`): The core indexing service that processes blockchain data

#### Environment Variables

The configuration uses environment variables with sensible defaults. For production, you should customize:

- Envio API token (`ENVIO_API_TOKEN`)
- Database credentials (`ENVIO_PG_PASSWORD`, `ENVIO_PG_USER`, etc.)
- Hasura admin secret (`HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET`)
- Resource limits based on your workload requirements

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues with self-hosting:

- Check the Envio GitHub repository at https://github.com/enviodev/hyperindex for known issues
- Join the Envio Discord community at https://discord.gg/envio for community support

**Recommendation**: For most production use cases, we recommend using the Envio Hosted Service to benefit from automatic scaling, monitoring, and maintenance.

---

## Summary

The Envio Hosted Service provides a comprehensive, production-ready platform for deploying and managing blockchain indexers with:

- **Multiple pricing tiers** from free development to enterprise dedicated hosting
