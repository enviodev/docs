# HyperRPC: Ultra-Fast Read-Only RPC

HyperRPC is an extremely fast read-only RPC designed specifically for data-intensive blockchain tasks. Built from the ground up to optimize performance, it offers a simple drop-in solution with dramatic speed improvements over traditional nodes.

:::info HyperSync vs. HyperRPC
**For most use cases, we recommend using [HyperSync](/docs/HyperSync/overview) over HyperRPC.**

HyperSync provides significantly faster performance and much greater flexibility in how you query and filter blockchain data. Behind the scenes, HyperRPC actually uses HyperSync to fulfill requests.

**When to use HyperRPC:**

- When you need a simple drop-in replacement for existing RPC-based code
- When you don't have time for a deeper integration
- When you're working with tools that expect standard JSON-RPC interfaces

**When to use HyperSync:**

- When performance is critical (HyperSync is much faster)
- When you need advanced filtering capabilities
- When you want more control over data formatting and field selection
- For new projects where you're designing the data access layer

## What is HyperRPC?

HyperRPC is a specialized JSON-RPC endpoint that focuses exclusively on **read operations** to deliver exceptional performance. By optimizing specifically for data retrieval workflows, HyperRPC can significantly outperform traditional nodes for data-intensive applications.

Key characteristics:

- **Read-only**: Optimized for data retrieval (cannot send transactions)
- **Drop-in compatible**: Works with existing tooling that uses standard RPC methods
- **Specialized**: Designed specifically for data-intensive operations like `eth_getLogs`

## Performance Advantages

Early benchmarks show that HyperRPC can deliver up to **5x performance improvement** for data-intensive operations compared to traditional nodes like `geth`, `erigon`, and `reth`.

This performance boost is particularly noticeable for:

- Historical data queries
- Log event filtering
- Block and transaction retrievals
- Analytics applications

## Supported Methods

HyperRPC currently supports the following Ethereum JSON-RPC methods:

| Category             | Methods                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chain Data**       | `eth_chainId`<br />`eth_blockNumber`                                                                                                                    |
| **Block Data**       | `eth_getBlockByNumber`<br />`eth_getBlockByHash`<br />`eth_getBlockReceipts`                                                                            |
| **Transaction Data** | `eth_getTransactionByHash`<br />`eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex`<br />`eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex`<br />`eth_getTransactionReceipt` |
| **Event Logs**       | `eth_getLogs`                                                                                                                                           |
| **Traces**           | `trace_block` (only on [select chains](./hyperrpc-supported-networks))                                                                                  |

## Supported Networks

HyperRPC is available across numerous EVM-compatible networks. For the most up-to-date list of supported chains, please see our [Supported Networks](./hyperrpc-supported-networks) page.

## Getting Started

To start using HyperRPC:

1. **Get Access**:

   - Visit our [Supported Networks](./hyperrpc-supported-networks) page to find all available HyperRPC endpoints
   - Each network has a ready-to-use URL that you can start using immediately

2. **Add Your API Token** (recommended):

   - Requests without an API token will be rate limited starting **June 2025** (same timeline as [HyperSync](/docs/HyperSync/api-tokens)).
   - Append your token to the endpoint URL. Example:

     ```text
     https://100.rpc.hypersync.xyz/<api-token>
     ```

   - If you don't have a token yet, you can generate one through the [Envio Dashboard](https://envio.dev/app/api-tokens).

3. **Use Like a Standard RPC**:

   ```javascript
   // Example: Fetching logs with HyperRPC
   const response = await fetch("https://100.rpc.hypersync.xyz/<api-token>", {
     method: "POST",
     headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       jsonrpc: "2.0",
       id: 1,
       method: "eth_getLogs",
       params: [
         {
           fromBlock: "0x1000000",
           toBlock: "0x1000100",
           address: "0xYourContractAddress",
         },
       ],
     }),
   });
   ```

4. **Provide Feedback**:
   Your testing and feedback are incredibly valuable as we continue to improve HyperRPC. Let us know about your experience in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Q9qt8gZ2fX).
