# HyperIndex: Fast Multichain Indexer

**HyperIndex** is a blazing-fast, developer-friendly multichain indexer, optimized for both local development and reliable hosted deployment. It empowers developers to effortlessly build robust backends for blockchain applications.

!Sync Process

:::info HyperIndex & HyperSync

**HyperIndex** is Envio's full-featured blockchain indexing framework that transforms on-chain events into structured, queryable databases with GraphQL APIs.

**HyperSync** is the high-performance data engine that powers HyperIndex. It provides the raw blockchain data access layer, delivering up to 2000x faster performance than traditional RPC endpoints.

While HyperIndex gives you a complete indexing solution with schema management and event handling, HyperSync can be used directly for custom data pipelines and specialized applications.
:::


## Hypersync API Token Requirements

Starting from **21 May 2025**, HyperSync (the data engine powering HyperIndex) will implement rate limits for requests without API tokens. Here's what you need to know:

- **Local Development**: No API token is required for local development, though requests will be rate limited.
- **Self-Hosted Deployments**: API tokens are required for unlimited HyperSync access in self-hosted deployments. The token can be set via the `ENVIO_API_TOKEN` environment variable in your indexer configuration. This can be read from the `.env` file in the root of your HyperIndex project.
- **Hosted Service**: Indexers deployed to our hosted service will have special access that doesn't require a custom API token.
- **Free Usage**: The service remains free to use until mid-June 2025.
- **Future Pricing**: From mid-June 2025 onwards, we will introduce tiered packages based on usage. Credits are calculated based on comprehensive metrics including data bandwidth, disk read operations, and other resource utilization factors. For preferred introductory pricing based on your specific use case, reach out to us on Discord.

For more details about API tokens, including how to generate and implement them, see our API Tokens documentation.

## Getting Started

**File:** `getting-started.md`

## Indexer Initialization

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** _(v18 or newer recommended)_
- **pnpm** _(v8 or newer)_
- **Docker Desktop** _(required to run the Envio indexer locally)_

> **Note:** Docker is specifically required to run your indexer locally. You can skip Docker installation if you plan only to use Envio's hosted service.


## Essential Files

After initialization, your indexer will contain three main files that are essential for its operation:

1. **`config.yaml`** – Defines indexing settings such as blockchain endpoints, events to index, and advanced behaviors.
2. **`schema.graphql`** – Defines the GraphQL schema for indexed data and its structure for efficient querying.
3. **`src/EventHandlers.*`** – Contains the logic for processing blockchain events.

> **Note:** The file extension for Event Handlers (`*.ts`, `*.js`, or `*.res`) depends on the programming language chosen (TypeScript, JavaScript, or ReScript).

You can customize your indexer by modifying these files to meet your specific requirements.


For a complete walkthrough of the process, refer to the Quickstart guide.

---

## Contract Import

**File:** `contract-import.md`

The **Quickstart** enables you to instantly autogenerate a powerful indexer and start querying blockchain data in minutes. This is the fastest and easiest way to begin using HyperIndex.

**Example:** Autogenerate an indexer for the Eigenlayer contract and index its entire history in less than 5 minutes by simply running `pnpx envio init` and providing the contract address from Etherscan.


### Video Tutorials






## Contract Import Methods

There are two convenient methods to import your contract:

- **Block Explorer** _(verified contracts on supported explorers like Etherscan and Blockscout)_
- **Local ABI** _(custom or unverified contracts)_

### 1. Block Explorer Import

This method uses a verified contract's address from a supported blockchain explorer (Etherscan, Routescan, etc.) to automatically fetch the ABI.

#### Steps:

**a. Select the blockchain**



:::note
HyperIndex supports all EVM-compatible chains. If your desired chain is not listed, you can import via the local ABI method or manually adjust the `config.yaml` file after initialization.
:::

**b. Enter the contract address**



:::tip
If using a proxy contract, always specify the **proxy address**, not the implementation address.
:::

**c. Select events to index**



**d. Finish or add more contracts**

You'll be prompted to continue adding more contracts or to complete the setup:




## Generated Files & Configuration

The Quickstart automatically generates key files:

### 1. `config.yaml`

Automatically configured parameters include:

- **Network ID**
- **Start Block**
- **Contract Name**
- **Contract Address**
- **Event Signatures**

By default, all selected events are included, but you can manually adjust the file if needed. See the detailed guide on `config.yaml`.

### 2. GraphQL Schema

- Entities are automatically generated for each selected event.
- Fields match the event parameters emitted.

See more details in the schema file guide.

### 3. Event Handlers

- Handlers are autogenerated for each event.
- Handlers create event-specific entities.

Learn more in the event handlers guide.

## HyperIndex Performance Benchmarks

**File:** `benchmarks.md`

## Overview

HyperIndex delivers industry-leading performance for blockchain data indexing. Independent benchmarks have consistently shown Envio's HyperIndex to be the fastest indexing solution available, with dramatic performance advantages over competitive offerings.

## Recent Independent Benchmarks

The most comprehensive and up-to-date benchmarks were conducted by Sentio in April 2025 and are available in the sentio-benchmark repository. These benchmarks compare Envio's HyperIndex against other popular indexers across multiple real-world scenarios:

### Key Performance Highlights

| Case                           | Description                                 | Envio  | Nearest Competitor          | TheGraph            | Ponder               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| LBTC Token Transfers           | Event handling, No RPC calls, Write-only    | 3m     | 8m - 2.6x slower (Sentio)   | 3h9m - 3780x slower | 1h40m - 2000x slower |
| LBTC Token with RPC calls      | Event handling, RPC calls, Read-after-write | 1m     | 6m - 6x slower (Sentio)     | 1h3m - 63x slower   | 45m - 45x slower     |
| Ethereum Block Processing      | 100K blocks with Metadata extraction        | 7.9s   | 1m - 7.5x slower (Subsquid) | 10m - 75x slower    | 33m - 250x slower    |
| Ethereum Transaction Gas Usage | Transaction handling, Gas calculations      | 1m 26s | 7m - 4.8x slower (Subsquid) | N/A                 | 33m - 23x slower     |
| Uniswap V2 Swap Trace Analysis | Transaction trace handling, Swap decoding   | 41s    | 2m - 3x slower (Subsquid)   | 8m - 11x slower     | N/A                  |
| Uniswap V2 Factory             | Event handling, Pair and swap analysis      | 8s     | 2m - 15x slower (Subsquid)  | 19m - 142x slower   | 21m - 157x slower    |

The independent benchmark results demonstrate that HyperIndex consistently outperforms all competitors across every tested scenario. This includes the most realistic real-world indexing scenario LBTC Token with RPC calls - where HyperIndex was up to 6x faster than the nearest competitor and over 63x faster than TheGraph.

## Historical Benchmarking Results

Our internal benchmarking from October 2023 showed similar performance advantages. When indexing the Uniswap V3 ETH-USDC pool contract on Ethereum Mainnet, HyperIndex achieved:

- 2.1x faster indexing than the nearest competitor
- Over 100x faster indexing than some popular alternatives

You can read the full details in our Indexer Benchmarking Results blog post.

## Verify For Yourself

We encourage developers to run their own benchmarks. You can use the templates provided in the Sentio benchmark repository or our sample indexer implementations for various scenarios.

## Migrate from TheGraph to HyperIndex

**File:** `migration-guide.md`

:::info
Please reach out to our team on Discord for personalized migration assistance.
:::

## Introduction

Migrating from a subgraph to HyperIndex is designed to be a developer-friendly process. HyperIndex draws strong inspiration from TheGraph’s subgraph architecture, which makes the migration simple, especially with the help of coding assistants like Cursor and AI tools (don't forget to use our ai friendly docs).

The process is simple but requires a good understanding of the underlying concepts. If you are new to HyperIndex, we recommend starting with the Getting Started guide.

## Why Migrate to HyperIndex?

- **Superior Performance**: Up to 100x faster indexing speeds
- **Lower Costs**: Reduced infrastructure requirements and operational expenses
- **Better Developer Experience**: Simplified configuration and deployment
- **Advanced Features**: Access to capabilities not available in other indexing solutions
- **Seamless Integration**: Easy integration with existing GraphQL APIs and applications

## Subgraph to HyperIndex Migration Overview

Migration consists of three major steps:

1. Subgraph.yaml migration
1. Schema migration - near copy paste
1. Event handler migration

At any point in the migration run

`pnpm envio codegen`

to verify the `config.yaml` and `schema.graphql` files are valid.

or run

`pnpm dev`

to verify the indexer is running and indexing correctly.

### 0.5 Use `npx envio init` to generate a boilerplate

As a first step, we recommend using `npx envio init` to generate a boilerplate for your project. This will handle the creation of the `config.yaml` file and a basic `schema.graphql` file with generic handler functions.

### 1. `subgraph.yaml` → `config.yaml`

`npx envio init` will generate this for you. It's a simple configuration file conversion. Effectively specifying which contracts to index, which networks to index (multiple networks can be specified with envio) and which events from those contracts to index.

Take the following conversion as an example, where the `subgraph.yaml` file is converted to `config.yaml` the below comparisons is for the Uniswap v4 pool manager subgraph.



theGraph - `subgraph.yaml`



HyperIndex - `config.yaml`




For any potential hurdles, please refer to the Configuration File documentation.

## 2. Schema migration

`copy` & `paste` the schema from the subgraph to the HyperIndex config file.

Small nuance differences:

- You can remove the `@entity` directive
- Enums
- BigDecimals

## 3. Event handler migration

This consists of two parts

1. Converting assemblyscript to typescript
1. Converting the subgraph syntax to HyperIndex syntax

### 3.1 Converting Assemblyscript to Typescript

The subgraph uses assemblyscript to write event handlers. The HyperIndex syntax is usually in typescript. Since assemblyscript is a subset of typescript, it's quite simple to copy and paste the code, especially so for pure functions.

### 3.2 Converting the subgraph syntax to HyperIndex syntax

There are some subtle differences in the syntax of the subgraph and HyperIndex. Including but not limited to the following:

- Replace Entity.save() with context.Entity.set()
- Convert to async handler functions
- Use `await` for loading entities `const x = await context.Entity.get(id)`
- Use dynamic contract registration to register contracts

The below code snippets can give you a basic idea of what this difference might look like.



theGraph - `eventHandler.ts`
`



HyperIndex - `eventHandler.ts`
`




## Extra tips

HyperIndex is a powerful tool that can be used to index any contract. There are some features that are especially powerful that go above subgraph implementations and so in some cases you may want to optimise your migration to HyperIndex further to take advantage of these features. Here are some useful tips:

- Use the `field_selection` option to add additional fields to your index. Doc here: field selection
- Use the `unordered_multichain_mode` option to enable unordered multichain mode, this is the most common need for multichain indexing. However comes with tradeoffs worth understanding. Doc here: unordered multichain mode
- Use wildcard indexing to index by event signatures rather than by contract address.
- HyperIndex uses the standard graphql query language, where as the subgraph uses a custom query language. You can read about the slight nuances here. (We are working on a basic tool to help with backwards compatibility, please check in with us on discord for it's current status).
- Loaders are a powerful feature to optimize historical sync performance. You can read more about them here.
- HyperIndex is very flexible and can be used to index offchain data too or send messages to a queue etc for fetching external data, you can further optimise the fetching by using the effects api

## Configuration File

**File:** `Guides/configuration-file.mdx`

The `config.yaml` file defines your indexer's behavior, including which blockchain events to index, contract addresses, which networks to index, and various advanced indexing options. It is a crucial step in configuring your HyperIndex setup.

After any changes to your `config.yaml` and the schema, run:



This command generates necessary types and code for your event handlers.


## Key Configuration Options

### Contract Addresses

Set the address of the smart contract you're indexing.

:::note
Addresses can be provided in **checksum** format or in **lowercase**.
Envio accepts both and normalizes them internally.
:::

**Single address:**



**Multiple addresses for the same contract:**



:::tip
If using a **proxy contract**, always use the **proxy address**, not the implementation address.
:::

**Global definitions:**  
You can also avoid repeating addresses by using global contract definitions:




### Raw Events Storage

By default, HyperIndex doesn't store raw event data in the database to optimize performance and reduce storage requirements. However, you can enable this feature for debugging purposes or if you need to access the original event data.

To enable storage of raw events, add the following to your `config.yaml`:



When enabled, all indexed events will be stored in the `raw_events` table in the database, which you can view through the Hasura interface. This is particularly useful for:

- Debugging event processing issues
- Verifying that events are being captured correctly
- Creating custom queries against raw blockchain data

Note that enabling this option will increase database storage requirements and may slightly impact indexing performance.


### Unordered Multichain Mode

To improve indexing performance when indexing multiple blockchains, you can enable **Unordered Multichain Mode**. This setting allows parallel processing of events from different networks without strictly maintaining cross-chain event ordering. Useful for minimizing indexing latency when indexing at the head.

Activate this by adding to your `config.yaml`:



Learn more about when and how to use this feature here.


### Environment Variables

Since `envio@2.9.0`, environment variable interpolation is supported for flexibility and security:



Run your indexer with custom environment variables:



**Interpolation syntax:**

- `${ENVIO_VAR}` – Use the value of `ENVIO_VAR`
- `${ENVIO_VAR:-default}` – Use `ENVIO_VAR` if set, otherwise use `default`

For more detailed information about environment variables, see our Environment Variables Guide.


### Output Directory Path

You can customize the path where the generated directory will be placed using the `output` option:



By default, the generated directory is placed in `generated` relative to the current working directory. If set, it will be a path relative to the config file location.

:::warning Advanced Configuration
This is an advanced configuration option. When using a custom output directory, you'll need to manually adjust your `.gitignore` file and project structure to match the new configuration.
:::

Explore detailed configuration schema parameters here:






---

## Schema File

**File:** `Guides/schema-file.md`

The **`schema.graphql`** file defines the data model for your HyperIndex indexer. Each entity type defined in this schema corresponds directly to a database table, with your event handlers responsible for creating and updating the records. HyperIndex automatically generates a GraphQL API based on these entity types, allowing easy access to the indexed data.


## Scalar Types

Scalar types represent basic data types and map directly to JavaScript, TypeScript, or ReScript types.

| **GraphQL Scalar** | **Description**                              | **JavaScript/TypeScript** | **ReScript**   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------- |
| `ID`               | Unique identifier                            | `string`                  | `string`       |
| `String`           | UTF-8 character sequence                     | `string`                  | `string`       |
| `Int`              | Signed 32-bit integer                        | `number`                  | `int`          |
| `Float`            | Signed floating-point number                 | `number`                  | `float`        |
| `Boolean`          | `true` or `false`                            | `boolean`                 | `bool`         |
| `Bytes`            | UTF-8 character sequence (hex prefixed `0x`) | `string`                  | `string`       |
| `BigInt`           | Signed integer (`int256` in Solidity)        | `bigint`                  | `bigint`       |
| `BigDecimal`       | Arbitrary-size floating-point                | `BigDecimal` (imported)   | `BigDecimal.t` |
| `Timestamp`        | Timestamp with timezone                      | `Date`                    | `Js.Date.t`    |
| `Json`             | JSON object (from envio@2.20)                | `Json`                    | `Js.Json.t`    |

Learn more about GraphQL scalars here.


## Enum Types

Enums allow fields to accept only a predefined set of values.

**Example:**



Enums translate to string unions (TypeScript/JavaScript) or polymorphic variants (ReScript):

**TypeScript Example:**



**ReScript Example:**




## Field Indexing (`@index`)

Add an index to a field for optimized queries and loader performance:



- All `id` fields and fields referenced via `@derivedFrom` are indexed automatically.


## Generating Types

Once you've defined your schema, run this command to generate these entity types that can be accessed in your event handlers:




You're now ready to define powerful schemas and efficiently query your indexed data with HyperIndex!

---

## Event Handlers

**File:** `Guides/event-handlers.mdx`



# Event Handlers

## Registration

A handler is a function that receives blockchain data, processes it, and inserts it into the database. You can register handlers in the file defined in the `handler` field in your `config.yaml` file. By default this is `src/EventHandlers.*` file.


  



  
  



  
  



  


:::note
The `generated` module contains code and types based on `config.yaml` and `schema.graphql` files. Update it by running **`pnpm codegen`** command whenever you change these files.
:::

### Basic Example

Here's a handler example for the `NewGreeting` event. It belongs to the `Greeter` contract from our beginners Greeter Tutorial:


  



  
  



  
  



  


### Advanced Use Cases

HyperIndex provides many features to help you build more powerful and efficient indexers. Read more about these on separate pages:

- Handle Factory Contracts with Dynamic Contract Registration (with nested factories support)
- Perform external calls to decide which contract address to register using Async Contract Register
- Index all ERC20 token transfers with Wildcard Indexing
- Use Topic Filtering to ignore irrelevant events
  - With multiple filters for single event
  - With different filters per network
  - With filter by dynamicly registered contract addresses (eg Index all ERC20 transfers to/from your Contract)
- Access Contract State directly from handlers
- Perform external calls from handlers by following the IPFS Integration guide
- Optimise database access with Loaders


## Context Object

The handler `context` provides methods to interact with entities stored in the database.

### Retrieving Entities

Retrieve entities from the database using `context.Entity.get` where `Entity` is the name of the entity you want to retrieve, which is defined in your schema.graphql file.



It'll return `Entity` object or `undefined` if the entity doesn't exist.

Starting from `envio@2.22.0` you can use `context.Entity.getOrThrow` to conveniently throw an error if the entity doesn't exist:



Or use `context.Entity.getOrCreate` to automatically create an entity with default values if it doesn't exist:



### Modifying Entities

Use `context.Entity.set` to create or update an entity:



:::note
Both `context.Entity.set` and `context.Entity.deleteUnsafe` methods use the In-Memory Storage under the hood and don't require `await` in front of them.
:::

### Deleting Entities (Unsafe)

To delete an entity:



:::warning
The `deleteUnsafe` method is experimental and **unsafe**. You need to manually handle all entity references after deletion to maintain database consistency.
:::

### Updating Specific Entity Fields

Use the following approach to update specific fields in an existing entity:


  



  
  



  
  



  


### `context.log`

The context object also provides a logger that you can use to log messages to the console. Compared to `console.log` calls, these logs will be displayed on our Hosted Service runtime logs page.

Read more in the Logging Guide.

## External Calls

Envio indexer runs using Node.js runtime. This means that you can use `fetch` or any other library like `viem` to perform external calls from your handlers.

Check out our IPFS Integration and Accessing Contract State guides for more information.

### `context.effect` (Experimental)

To ensure consistent and reliable data, all handlers are executed synchronously in the on-chain order. This means that external calls might easily blow up the processing time.

To avoid this, you can use Loaders together with Effect API to parallelize external calls and make the indexing process more efficient.



Read more about the Effect API and Loaders in the dedicated guides.


## Performance Considerations

For performance optimization and best practices, refer to:

- Benchmarking
- Loaders

These guides offer detailed recommendations on optimizing entity loading and indexing performance.

## Multichain Indexing

**File:** `Advanced/multichain-indexing.mdx`



# Understanding Multichain Indexing

Multichain indexing allows you to monitor and process events from contracts deployed across multiple blockchain networks within a single indexer instance. This capability is essential for applications that:

- Track the same contract deployed across multiple networks
- Need to aggregate data from different chains into a unified view
- Monitor cross-chain interactions or state

## How It Works

With multichain indexing, events from contracts deployed on multiple chains can be used to create and update entities defined in your schema file. Your indexer will process events from all configured networks, maintaining proper synchronization across chains.

## Configuration Requirements

To implement multichain indexing, you need to:

1. Populate the `networks` section in your `config.yaml` file for each chain
2. Specify contracts to index from each network
3. Create event handlers for the specified contracts

## Real-World Example: Uniswap V4 Multichain Indexer

For a comprehensive, production-ready example of multichain indexing, we recommend exploring our Uniswap V4 Multichain Indexer. This official reference implementation:

- Indexes Uniswap V4 deployments across 10 different blockchain networks
- Powers the official v4.xyz interface with real-time data
- Demonstrates best practices for high-performance multichain indexing
- Provides a complete, production-grade implementation you can study and adapt

!V4 indexer

The Uniswap V4 indexer showcases how to effectively structure a multichain indexer for a complex DeFi protocol, handling high volumes of data across multiple networks while maintaining performance and reliability.

## Config File Structure for Multichain Indexing

The `config.yaml` file for multichain indexing contains three key sections:

1. **Global contract definitions** - Define contracts, ABIs, and events once
2. **Network-specific configurations** - Specify chain IDs and starting blocks
3. **Contract instances** - Reference global contracts with network-specific addresses



### Key Configuration Concepts

- The global `contracts` section defines the contract interface, ABI, handlers, and events once
- The `networks` section lists each blockchain network you want to index
- Each network entry references the global contract and provides the network-specific address
- This structure allows you to reuse the same handler functions and event definitions across networks

> 📢 **Best Practice**: When developing multichain indexers, append the chain ID to entity IDs to avoid collisions. For example: `user-1` for Ethereum and `user-137` for Polygon.

## Multichain Event Ordering

When indexing multiple chains, you have two approaches for handling event ordering:

### Unordered Multichain Mode

:::note
Unordered mode is recommended for most applications.
:::

The indexer processes events as soon as they're available from each chain, without waiting for other chains. This "Unordered Multichain Mode" provides better performance and lower latency.

- Events will still be processed in order within each individual chain
- Events across different chains may be processed out of order
- Processing happens as soon as events are emitted, reducing latency
- You avoid waiting for the slowest chain's block time

This mode is ideal for most applications, especially when:

- Operations on your entities are commutative (order doesn't matter)
- Entities from different networks never interact with each other
- Processing speed is more important than guaranteed cross-chain ordering

#### How to Enable Unordered Mode

In your config.yaml:



### Ordered Mode

:::note
Ordered mode is currently the default mode. But it'll be changed to unordered mode in the future. If you don't need strict deterministic ordering of events across all chains, it's recommended to use unordered mode.
:::

If your application requires strict deterministic ordering of events across all chains, you can enable "Ordered Mode". In this mode, the indexer synchronizes event processing across all chains, ensuring that events are processed in the exact same order in every indexer run, regardless of which chain they came from.

#### When to Use Ordered Mode

Use ordered mode only when:

- The exact ordering of operations across different chains is critical to your application logic
- You need guaranteed deterministic results across all indexer runs
- You're willing to accept higher latency for cross-chain consistency

Cross-chain ordering is particularly important for applications like:

- **Bridge applications**: Where messages or assets must be processed on one chain before being processed on another chain
- **Cross-chain governance**: Where decisions made on one chain affect operations on another chain
- **Multi-chain financial applications**: Where the sequence of transactions across chains affects accounting or risk calculations
- **Data consistency systems**: Where the state must be consistent across multiple chains in a specific order

#### Technical Details

With ordered mode enabled:

- The indexer needs to wait for all blocks to increment from each network
- There is increased latency between when an event is emitted and when it's processed
- Processing speed is limited by the block interval of the slowest network
- Events are guaranteed to be processed in the same order in every indexer run

#### Cross-Chain Ordering Preservation

Ordered mode ensures that the temporal relationship between events on different chains is preserved. This is achieved by:

1. **Global timestamp ordering**: Events are ordered based on their block timestamps across all chains
2. **Deterministic processing**: The same sequence of events will be processed in the same order every time

The primary trade-off is increased latency at the head of the chain. Since the indexer must wait for blocks from all chains to determine the correct ordering, the processing of recent events is delayed by the slowest chain's block time. For example, if Chain A has 2-second blocks and Chain B has 15-second blocks, the indexer will process events at the slower 15-second rate to maintain proper ordering.

This latency is acceptable for applications where correct cross-chain ordering is more important than real-time updates. For bridge applications in particular, this ordering preservation can be critical for security and correctness, as it ensures that deposit events on one chain are always processed before the corresponding withdrawal events on another chain.

## Best Practices for Multichain Indexing

### 1. Entity ID Namespacing

Always namespace your entity IDs with the chain ID to prevent collisions between networks. This ensures that entities from different networks remain distinct.

### 2. Error Handling

Implement robust error handling for network-specific issues. A failure on one chain shouldn't prevent indexing from continuing on other chains.

### 3. Testing

- Test your indexer with realistic scenarios across all networks
- Use testnet deployments for initial validation
- Verify entity updates work correctly across chains

### 4. Performance Considerations

- Use unordered mode when appropriate for better performance
- Consider your indexing frequency based on the block times of each chain
- Monitor resource usage, as indexing multiple chains increases load

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Different Network Speeds**: If one network is significantly slower than others, consider using unordered mode to prevent bottlenecks.

2. **Entity Conflicts**: If you see unexpected entity updates, verify that your entity IDs are properly namespaced with chain IDs.

3. **Memory Usage**: If your indexer uses excessive memory, consider optimizing your entity structure and implementing pagination in your queries.

## Testing

**File:** `Guides/testing.mdx`



## Introduction

Envio comes with a built-in testing library that enables developers to thoroughly validate their indexer behavior without requiring deployment or interaction with actual blockchains. This library is specifically crafted to:

- **Mock database states**: Create and manipulate in-memory representations of your database
- **Simulate blockchain events**: Generate test events that mimic real blockchain activity
- **Assert event handler logic**: Verify that your handlers correctly process events and update entities
- **Test complete workflows**: Validate the entire process from event creation to database updates

The testing library provides helper functions that integrate with any JavaScript-based testing framework (like Mocha, Jest, or others), giving you flexibility in how you structure and run your tests.

## Learn by doing

If you prefer to explore by example, the Greeter template includes complete tests that demonstrate best practices:

1. Generate `greeter` template in TypeScript using Envio CLI



2. Run tests



3. See the `test/test.ts` file to understand how the tests are written.


## Writing tests

### Test Library Design

The testing library follows key design principles that make it effective for testing HyperIndex indexers:

- **Immutable database**: The mock database is immutable, with each operation returning a new instance. This makes it robust and easy to test against previous states.
- **Chainable operations**: Operations can be chained together to build complex test scenarios.
- **Realistic simulations**: Mock events closely mirror real blockchain events, allowing you to test your handlers in conditions similar to production.

### Typical Test Flow

Most tests will follow this general pattern:

1. Initialize the mock database (empty or with predefined entities)
2. Create a mock event with test parameters
3. Process the mock event through your handler(s)
4. Assert that the resulting database state matches your expectations

This flow allows you to verify that your event handlers correctly create, update, or modify entities in response to blockchain events.


## Assertions

The testing library works with any JavaScript assertion library. In the examples, we use Node.js's built-in assert module, but you can also use popular alternatives like chai or expect.

Common assertion patterns include:

- `assert.deepEqual(expectedEntity, actualEntity)` - Check that entire entities match
- `assert.equal(expectedValue, actualEntity.property)` - Verify specific property values
- `assert.ok(updatedMockDb.entities.Entity.get(id))` - Ensure an entity exists


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your tests, check the following:

### Environment and Setup

1. **Verify your Envio version**: The testing library is available in versions `v0.0.26` and above

   

2. **Ensure you've generated testing code**: Always run codegen after updating your schema or config

   

3. **Check your imports**: Make sure you're importing the correct files


   



  
  



  
  



  


### Common Issues and Solutions

- **"Cannot read properties of undefined"**: This usually means an entity wasn't found in the database. Verify your IDs match exactly and that the entity exists before accessing it.

- **"Type mismatch"**: Ensure that your entity structure matches what's defined in your schema. Type issues are common when working with numeric types (like `BigInt` vs `number`).

- **ReScript specific setup**: If using ReScript, remember to update your `rescript.json` file:

  

- **Debug database state**: If you're having trouble with assertions, add a debug log to see the exact state of your entities:

## Navigating Hasura

**File:** `Guides/navigating-hasura.md`

> This page is only relevant when testing on a local machine or using a self-hosted version of Envio that uses Hasura.

## Introduction

Hasura is a GraphQL engine that provides a web interface for interacting with your indexed blockchain data. When running HyperIndex locally, Hasura serves as your primary tool for:

- Querying indexed data via GraphQL
- Visualizing database tables and relationships
- Testing API endpoints before integration with your frontend
- Monitoring the indexing process

This guide explains how to navigate the Hasura dashboard to effectively work with your indexed data.

## Accessing Hasura

When running HyperIndex locally, Hasura is automatically available at:



You can access this URL in any web browser to open the Hasura console.

:::note
When prompted for authentication, use the password: `testing`
:::

## Key Dashboard Areas

The Hasura dashboard has several tabs, but we'll focus on the two most important ones for HyperIndex developers:

### API Tab

The API tab lets you execute GraphQL queries and mutations on indexed data. It serves as a GraphQL playground for testing your API calls.



#### Features

- **Explorer Panel**: The left panel shows all available entities defined in your `schema.graphql` file
- **Query Builder**: The center area is where you write and execute GraphQL queries
- **Results Panel**: The right panel displays query results in JSON format

#### Available Entities

By default, you'll see:

- All entities defined in your `schema.graphql` file
- `dynamic_contracts` (for dynamically added contracts)
- `raw_events` table (Note: This table is no longer populated by default to improve performance. To enable storage of raw events, add `raw_events: true` to your `config.yaml` file as described in the Raw Events Storage section)

#### Example Query

Try a simple query to test your indexer:



Click the "Play" button to execute the query and see the results.

For more advanced GraphQL query options, see Hasura's quickstart guide.

### Data Tab

The Data tab provides direct access to your database tables and relationships, allowing you to view the actual indexed data.



#### Features

- **Schema Browser**: View all tables in the database (left panel)
- **Table Data**: Examine and browse data within each table
- **Relationship Viewer**: See how different entities are connected

#### Working with Tables

1. Select any table from the "public" schema to view its contents
2. Use the "Browse Rows" tab to see all data in that table
3. Check the "Insert Row" tab to manually add data (useful for testing)
4. View the "Modify" tab to see the table structure

#### Verifying Indexed Data

To confirm your indexer is working correctly:

1. Check entity tables to ensure they contain the expected data
2. Look at the `db_write_timestamp` column values to confirm when data was last updated
3. Newer timestamps indicate fresh data; older timestamps might indicate stale data from previous runs

## Common Tasks

### Checking Indexing Status

To verify your indexer is actively processing new blocks:

1. Go to the Data tab
2. Select any entity table
3. Check the latest `db_write_timestamp` values
4. Monitor these values over time to ensure they're updating

(Note the TUI is also an easy way to monitor this)

### Troubleshooting Missing Data

If expected data isn't appearing:

1. Check if you've enabled raw events storage (`raw_events: true` in `config.yaml`) and then examine the `raw_events` table to confirm events were captured
2. Verify your event handlers are correctly processing these events
3. Examine your GraphQL queries to ensure they match your schema structure
4. Check console logs for any processing errors

### Resetting Indexed Data

When testing, you may need to reset your database:

1. Stop your indexer
2. Reset your database (refer to the development guide for commands)
3. Restart your indexer to begin processing from the configured start block

## Best Practices

- **Regular Verification**: Periodically check both the API and Data tabs to ensure your indexer is functioning correctly
- **Query Testing**: Test complex queries in the API tab before implementing them in your application
- **Schema Validation**: Use the Data tab to verify that relationships between entities are correctly established
- **Performance Monitoring**: Watch for tables that grow unusually large, which might indicate inefficient indexing

---

## Environment Variables

**File:** `Guides/environment-variables.md`

Environment variables are a crucial part of configuring your Envio indexer. They allow you to manage sensitive information and configuration settings without hardcoding them in your codebase.

## Naming Convention

All environment variables used by Envio must be prefixed with `ENVIO_`. This naming convention:
- Prevents conflicts with other environment variables
- Makes it clear which variables are used by the Envio indexer
- Ensures consistency across different environments

## Example Environment Variables

Here are some commonly used environment variables:



## Setting Environment Variables

### Local Development

For local development, you can set environment variables in several ways:

1. Using a `.env` file in your project root:


2. Directly in your terminal:


### Hosted Service

When using the Envio Hosted Service, you can configure environment variables through the Envio platform's dashboard. Remember that all variables must still be prefixed with `ENVIO_`.

For more information about environment variables in the hosted service, see the Hosted Service documentation.

## Configuration File

For use of environment variables in your configuration file, read the docs here: Configuration File.

## Best Practices

1. **Never commit sensitive values**: Always use environment variables for sensitive information like API keys and database credentials
1. **Never commit or use private keys**: Never commit or use private keys in your codebase
1. **Use descriptive names**: Make your environment variable names clear and descriptive
1. **Document your variables**: Keep a list of required environment variables in your project's README
1. **Use different values**: Use different environment variables for development, staging, and production environments
1. **Validate required variables**: Check that all required environment variables are set before starting your indexer

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with environment variables:

1. Verify that all required variables are set
2. Check that variables are prefixed with `ENVIO_`
3. Ensure there are no typos in variable names
4. Confirm that the values are correctly formatted

For more help, see our Troubleshooting Guide.

## Indexing Optimism Bridge Deposits

**File:** `Tutorials/tutorial-op-bridge-deposits.md`

## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through indexing Optimism Standard Bridge deposits in under 5 minutes using Envio HyperIndex's no-code contract import feature.

The Optimism Standard Bridge enables the movement of ETH and ERC-20 tokens between Ethereum and Optimism. We'll index bridge deposit events by extracting the `DepositFinalized` logs emitted by the bridge contracts on both networks.



## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** _(v18 or newer recommended)_
- **pnpm** _(v8 or newer)_
- **Docker Desktop** _(required to run the Envio indexer locally)_

Now that you have installed the prerequisite packages let's begin the practical steps of setting up the indexer.

Open your terminal in an empty directory and initialize a new indexer by running the command:



In the following prompt, choose the directory where you want to set up your project. The default is the current directory, but in the tutorial, I'll use the indexer name:



Then, choose a language of your choice for the event handlers. TypeScript is the most popular one, so we'll stick with it:



Next, we have the new prompt for a blockchain ecosystem. Previously Envio supported only EVM, but now it's possible to choose between `Evm`, `Fuel` and other VMs in the future:



In the following prompt, you can choose an initialization option. There's a Greeter template for Fuel, which is an excellent way to learn more about HyperIndex. But since we have an existing contract, the `Contract Import` option is the best way to create an indexer:



> A separate Tutorial page provides more details about the `Greeter` template.

Next it'll ask us for an ABI file. You can find it in the `./out/debug` directory after building your Sway contract with `forc build`:



After the ABI file is provided, Envio parses all possible events you can use for indexing:



Let's select the events we want to index. I opened the code of the contract file and realized that for a leaderboard we need only events which update player information. Hence, I left only `NewPlayer`, `LevelUp`, and `SellItem` selected in the list. We'd want to index more events in real life, but this is enough for the tutorial.



> 📖 For the tutorial we only need to index `LOG_DATA` receipts, but you can also index `Mint`, `Burn`, `Transfer` and `Call` receipts. Read more about Supported Event Types.

Just a few simple questions left. Let's call our contract `SwayFarm`:



Set an address for the deployed contract:



Finish the initialization process:



If you see the following line, it means we are already halfway through 🙌



Let's open the indexer in an IDE and start adjusting it for our farm 🍅

## Walk through initialized indexer

At this point, we should already have a working indexer. You can start it by running `pnpm dev`, which we cover in more detail later in the tutorial.

Everything is configured by modifying the 3 files below. Let's walk through each of them.

- config.yaml `Guide`
- schema.graphql `Guide`
- EventHandlers.\* `Guide`

> (\* depending on the language chosen for the indexer)

### `config.yaml`

The `config.yaml` outlines the specifications for the indexer, including details such as network and contract specifications and the event information to be used in the indexing process.



In the tutorial, we don't need to adjust it in any way. But later you can modify the file and add more events for indexing.

As a nice to have, you can use a Sway struct name without specifying a `logId`, like this:



### `schema.graphql`

The `schema.graphql` file serves as a representation of your application's data model. It defines entity types that directly correspond to database tables, and the event handlers you create are responsible for creating and updating records within those tables. Additionally, the GraphQL API is automatically generated based on the entity types specified in the `schema.graphql` file, to allow access to the indexed data.

> 🧠 A separate Guide page provides more details about the `schema.graphql` file.

For the leaderboard, we need only one entity representing the player. Let's create it:



We will use the user address as an ID. The fields `farmingSkill` and `totalValueSold` are `u64` in Sway, so to safely map them to JavaScript value, we'll use `BigInt`.

### `EventHandlers.ts`

The event handlers generated by contract import are quite simple and only add an entity to a DB when a related event is indexed.



Let's modify the handlers to update the `Player` entity instead. But before we start, we need to run `pnpm codegen` to generate utility code and types for the `Player` entity we've added.



It's time for a little bit of coding. The indexer is very simple; it requires us only to pass event data to an entity.



Without overengineering, simply set the player data into the database. What's nice is that whenever your ABI or entities in `graphql.schema` change, Envio regenerates types and shows the compilation error.

> 🧠 You can find the indexer repo created during the tutorial on GitHub.

## Starting the Indexer

> 📢 Make sure you have docker open

The following commands will start the docker and create databases for indexed data. Make sure to re-run `pnpm dev` if you've made some changes.





Nice, we indexed `1,721,352` blocks containing `58,784` events in 10 seconds, and they continue coming in.

## View the indexed results

Let's check indexed players on the local Hasura server.



The Hasura admin-secret / password is `testing`, and the tables can be viewed in the data tab or queried from the playground.



Now, we can easily get the top 5 players, the number of inactive and active players, and the average sold value. What's left is a nice UI for the Sway Farm leaderboard, but that's not the tutorial's topic.

> 🧠 A separate Guide page provides more details about navigating Hasura.

## Deploy the indexer onto the hosted service

Once you have verified that the indexer is working for your contracts, then you are ready to deploy the indexer onto our hosted service.

Deploying an indexer onto the hosted service allows you to extract information via graphQL queries into your front-end or some back-end application.

Navigate to the hosted service to start deploying your indexer and refer to this documentation for more information on deploying your indexer.

## Indexing a Greeter Contract

**File:** `Tutorials/greeter-tutorial.md`

## Introduction

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to indexing a simple Greeter smart contract deployed on multiple blockchains. You'll learn how to set up and run a multi-chain indexer using Envio's template system.

### What is the Greeter Contract?

The Greeter contract is a straightforward smart contract that allows users to store greeting messages on the blockchain. For this tutorial, we'll be indexing instances of this contract deployed on both **Polygon** and **Linea** networks.

### What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:

- A functioning multi-chain indexer that tracks greeting events
- The ability to query these events through a GraphQL endpoint
- Experience with Envio's core indexing functionality

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** _(v18 or newer recommended)_
- **pnpm** _(v8 or newer)_
- **Docker Desktop** _(required to run the Envio indexer locally)_

> **Note:** Docker is specifically required to run your indexer locally. You can skip Docker installation if you plan only to use Envio's hosted service.

## Step 1: Initialize Your Project

First, let's create a new project using Envio's Greeter template:

1. Open your terminal and run:



2. When prompted for a directory, you can press Enter to use the current directory or specify another path:



3. Choose your preferred programming language for event handlers:



4. Select the **Template** initialization option:



5. Choose the **Greeter** template:



After completing these steps, Envio will generate all the necessary files for your indexer project.

## Step 2: Understanding the Generated Files

Let's examine the key files that were created:

### `config.yaml`

This configuration file defines which networks and contracts to index:



### `schema.graphql`

This schema defines the data structures for the indexed events:



### `src/EventHandlers.js` (or `.ts`/`.res`)

This file contains the logic to process events emitted by the Greeter contract.

## Step 3: Start Your Indexer

> **Important:** Make sure Docker Desktop is running before proceeding.

1. Start the indexer with:



This command:

- Launches Docker containers for the database and Hasura
- Sets up your local development environment
- Begins indexing data from the specified contracts
- Opens a terminal UI to monitor indexing progress

The indexer will retrieve data from both Polygon and Linea blockchains, starting from the blocks specified in your `config.yaml` file.

## Step 4: Interact with the Contracts

To see your indexer in action, you can write new greetings to the blockchain:

### For Polygon:

1. Visit the contract on Polygonscan
2. Connect your wallet
3. Use the `setGreeting` function to write a new greeting
4. Submit the transaction

### For Linea:

1. Visit the contract on Lineascan
2. Connect your wallet
3. Use the `setGreeting` function to write a new greeting
4. Submit the transaction

Since this is a multi-chain example, you can interact with both contracts to see how Envio handles data from different blockchains simultaneously.

## Step 5: Query the Indexed Data

Now you can explore the data your indexer has captured:

1. Open Hasura at http://localhost:8080
2. When prompted for authentication, use the password: `testing`
3. Navigate to the **Data** tab to browse the database tables
4. Or use the **API** tab to write GraphQL queries

### Example Query

Try this query to see the latest greetings:



## Step 6: Deploy to Production (Optional)

When you're ready to move from local development to production:

1. Visit the Envio Hosted Service
2. Follow the steps to deploy your indexer
3. Get a production GraphQL endpoint for your application

For detailed deployment instructions, see the Hosted Service documentation.

## What You've Learned

By completing this tutorial, you've learned:

- How to initialize an Envio project from a template
- How indexers process data from multiple blockchains
- How to query indexed data using GraphQL
- The basic structure of an Envio indexing project

## Next Steps

Now that you've mastered the basics, you can:

- Try the Contract Import feature to index any deployed contract
- Customize the event handlers to implement more complex indexing logic
- Add relationships between entities in your schema
- Explore the Advanced Querying features
- Create aggregated statistics from your indexed data

## Getting Price Data in Your Indexer

**File:** `Tutorials/price-data.md`

## Introduction

Many blockchain applications require price data to calculate values such as:

- Historical token transfer values in USD
- Total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols over time
- Portfolio valuations at specific points in time

This tutorial explores three different approaches to incorporating price data into your Envio indexer, using a real-world example of tracking ETH deposits into a Uniswap V3 liquidity pool on the Blast blockchain.

> **TL;DR:** The complete code for this tutorial is available in this GitHub repository.

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll:

- Compare three different methods for accessing token price data
- Analyze the tradeoffs between accuracy, decentralization, and performance
- Implement a multi-source price feed in an Envio indexer
- Build a practical example indexing Uniswap V3 liquidity events with price context

## Price Data Methods Compared

There are three primary methods to access price data within your indexer:

| Method         | Description                                  | Speed | Accuracy    | Decentralization |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Oracles        | On-chain price feeds (e.g., API3, Chainlink) | Fast  | Medium      | Medium           |
| DEX Pools      | Swap events from decentralized exchanges     | Fast  | Medium-High | High             |
| Off-chain APIs | External services (e.g., CoinGecko)          | Slow  | High        | Low              |

Let's explore each method in detail.

## Method 1: Using Oracle Price Feeds

Oracle networks provide on-chain price data through specialized smart contracts. For this tutorial, we'll use API3 price feeds on Blast.

### How Oracles Work

Oracle services like API3 maintain a network of data providers that push price updates to on-chain contracts. These updates typically occur:

- At regular time intervals
- When price deviations exceed a predefined threshold (e.g., 1%)
- When manually triggered by network participants

### Finding the Right Oracle Feed

To locate the ETH/USD price feed using API3 on Blast:

1. Identify the API3 contract address: `0x709944a48cAf83535e43471680fDA4905FB3920a`

2. Find the data feed ID for ETH/USD:

   - The dAPI name "ETH/USD" as bytes32: `0x4554482f55534400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
   - Using the `dapiNameToDataFeedId` function, this maps to `0x3efb3990846102448c3ee2e47d22f1e5433cd45fa56901abe7ab3ffa054f70b5`

3. Monitor the `UpdatedBeaconSetWithBeacons` events with this data feed ID to get price updates

### Oracle Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages:**

- Fast indexing (no external API calls required)
- Moderate decentralization
- Generally reliable data

**Limitations:**

- Updates only on significant price changes
- Limited token coverage (mainly high-liquidity pairs)
- Minor accuracy tradeoffs

## Method 2: Using DEX Pool Swap Events

Decentralized exchanges like Uniswap provide price data through swap events. We'll use the USDB/WETH pool on Blast to derive ETH pricing.

### Locating the Right DEX Pool

First, we need to find the specific Uniswap V3 pool for USDB/WETH:



> **Tip:** You can also manually find the pool address using the `getPool` function on a block explorer.

Running this code reveals the USDB/WETH pool is at `0xf52B4b69123CbcF07798AE8265642793b2E8990C`.

### Getting Price Data From Swap Events

Uniswap V3 emits `Swap` events containing price information in the `sqrtPriceX96` field. To convert this to a price, we'll use a formula in our event handler.

### DEX Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages:**

- Very decentralized
- High update frequency
- Wide token coverage

**Limitations:**

- Susceptible to price impact and manipulation (especially in low-liquidity pools)
- Requires extra calculations to derive prices
- May require multiple pools for cross-pair calculations

## Method 3: Using Off-chain APIs

External price APIs like CoinGecko provide comprehensive token price data but require HTTP calls from your indexer.

### Making API Requests

Here's a simple function to fetch historical ETH prices from CoinGecko:



### Step 2: Configure Your Indexer

Edit your `config.yaml` file to track both the API3 oracle and the Uniswap V3 pool:



> **Important:** The `field_selection` section is needed to include transaction hashes in your indexed data.

### Step 3: Define Your Schema

Create a schema that captures price data from all three sources:



### Step 4: Implement Event Handlers

Create event handlers to process data from all three sources:



## Results Analysis

When comparing our three price data sources, we found:

!Table of indexer results

Looking at the `offchainOracleDiff` column, we can see that oracle and off-chain prices typically align closely but can deviate by as much as 17.98% in some cases.

For the highlighted transaction (0xe7e79ddf29ed2f0ea8cb5bb4ffdab1ea23d0a3a0a57cacfa875f0d15768ba37d), we can compare our calculated values:

- **Actual value** (from block explorer): $2,358.27
- **DEX pool value** (`depositedPool`): $2,117.07
- **Off-chain API value** (`depositedOffchain`): $2,156.15

This demonstrates that even the most accurate methods have limitations.

## Conclusion: Choosing the Right Method

Based on our analysis, here are some recommendations for choosing a price data method:

### Use Oracle or DEX Pools when:

- Indexing speed is critical
- Absolute precision isn't required
- You're working with high-liquidity tokens

### Use Off-chain APIs when:

- Price accuracy is paramount
- Indexing speed is less important
- You can implement effective caching

### For maximum accuracy while maintaining performance:

- Combine multiple methods and aggregate results
- Use high-volume DEX pools on major networks
- Cache API results to avoid redundant calls

## Next Steps

To further enhance your price data indexing:

1. **Implement caching** for off-chain API calls
2. **Cross-reference multiple DEX pools** for better accuracy
3. **Consider time-weighted average prices (TWAP)** instead of spot prices
4. **Use multi-chain indexing** to access higher-liquidity pools on major networks

By carefully choosing and implementing the right price data strategy, you can build robust indexers that provide accurate financial data for your blockchain applications.

## Dynamic Contracts / Factories

**File:** `Advanced/dynamic-contracts.md`

## Introduction

Many blockchain systems use factory patterns where new contracts are created dynamically. Common examples include:

- DEXes like Uniswap where each trading pair creates a new contract
- NFT platforms that deploy new collection contracts
- Lending protocols that create new markets as isolated contracts

When indexing these systems, you need a way to discover and track these dynamically created contracts. Envio provides powerful tools to handle this use case.

### Contract Registration Handler

Instead of a template based approach, we've introduced a `contractRegister` handler that can be added to any event.

This allows you to easily:

- Register contracts from any event handler.
- Use conditions and any logic you want to register contracts.
- Have nested factories which are registered by other factories.



## Example: NFT Factory Pattern

Let's look at a complete example using an NFT factory pattern.

### Scenario

- `NftFactory` contract creates new `SimpleNft` contracts
- We want to index events from all NFTs created by this factory
- Each time a new NFT is created, the factory emits a `SimpleNftCreated` event

### 1. Configure Your Contracts in config.yaml



Note that:

- The `NftFactory` contract has a known address specified in the config
- The `SimpleNft` contract has no address, as we'll register instances dynamically

### 2. Create the Contract Registration Handler

In your `src/EventHandlers.ts` file:



## Async Contract Register

As of version `2.21`, you can use async contract registration.

This is a unique feature of Envio that allows you to perform an external call to determine the address of the contract to register.



## When to Use Dynamic Contract Registration

Use dynamic contract registration when:

- Your system includes factory contracts that deploy new contracts over time
- You want to index events from all instances of a particular contract type
- The addresses of these contracts aren't known at the time you create your indexer

## Important Notes

- **Block Coverage**: When a dynamic contract is registered, Envio will index all events from that contract in the same block where it was created, even if those events happened in transactions before the registration event. This is particularly useful for contracts that emit events during their construction.

- **Handler Organization**: You can register contracts from any event handler. For example, you might register a token contract when you see it being added to a registry, not just when it's created.

- **Pre-registration**: Pre-registration was a recommended mode to optimize performance. But starting from version `2.19` the option is removed in favor of the default behavior, which got even faster.

## Debugging Tips

- Use logging in your `contractRegister` function to confirm contracts are being registered.
- If you're not seeing events from your dynamic contracts, verify they're being properly registered in database.

For more information on writing event handlers, see the Event Handlers Guide.

---

## Wildcard Indexing

**File:** `Advanced/wildcard-indexing.mdx`



Wildcard indexing is a feature that allows you to index all events matching a specified event signature without requiring the contract address from which the event was emitted. This is useful in cases such as indexing contracts deployed through factories, where the factory contract does not emit any events upon contract creation. It also enables indexing events from all contracts implementing a standard (e.g. all ERC20 transfers).

:::note
Wildcard Indexing is supported for HyperSync & HyperFuel data sources starting from `v2.3.0`.
For the RPC data source support added in the `v2.12.0` release.
:::

## Index all ERC20 transfers

As an example, let's say we want to index all ERC20 `Transfer` events. Start with a `config.yaml` file:



Let's also define some entities in `schema.graphql` file, so our handlers can store the processed data:



And the last bit is to register an event handler in the `src/EventHandlers.ts`. Note how we pass the `wildcard: true` option to enable wildcard indexing:


  



  


After running your indexer with `pnpm dev` you will have all ERC20 `Transfer` events indexed, regardless of the contract address from which the event was emitted.

## Topic Filtering

Indexing all ERC20 `Transfer` events is a lot of events, so ideally to reduce it only to the ones you trully need with the Topic Filtering feature.

When you register an event handler or a contract register you can provide the `eventFilters` option. You can filter by each `indexed` parameter on the given event.

Let's say you only want to index `Mint` events where the `from` address is equal to `ZERO_ADDRESS`:


  



  
  



  
  



  


## Multiple Filters

If you want to index both `Mint` and `Burn` events you can provide multiple filters as an array. Also, every parameter can accept an array to filter by multiple possible values. We'll use it to filter by a group of whitelisted addresses in the example below:


  



  
  



  
  



  


## Different Filters per Network

For Multichain Indexers you can pass a function to `eventFilters` and use `chainId` to filter by different values per network:


  



  
  



  


## Index all ERC20 transfers to your Contract

Besides `chainId` you can also access the `addresses` value to filter by.

For example, if you have a `Safe` contract, you can index all ERC20 transfers sent specifically to/from your `Safe` contracts. The event filter gets addresses belonging to the contract, so we need to define the `Transfer` event on the `Safe` contract:




  



  
  



  


This example is not much different from using a `WHITELISTED_ADDRESSES` constant, but this becomes much more powerful when the `Safe` contract addresses are registered dynamically by a factory contract:




  



  
  



  


### Assert ERC20 Transfers in Handler

After you got all ERC20 Transfers relevant to your contracts, you can additionally filter them in the handler. For example, to get only `USDC` transfers:


  



  


## Contract Register Example

The same `eventFilters` can be applied to `contractRegister` and `handlerWithLoader` APIs. Here is an example where we only register Uniswap pools that contain DAI token:


  



  
  



  
  



  


## Handler With Loader Example

For `handlerWithLoader` API simply add `wildcard` or `eventFilters` options to the single argument object:



## Limitations

- For any given network, only one event of a given signature can be indexed using wildcard indexing. This means that if you have multiple contract definitions in your config that contain the same event signature. Only one of them is allowed to be set to `wildcard: true`

- Either the `contractRegister` or the `handler` function can take an event config object (with wildcard/eventFilters fields) but not both.

- The RPC data source currently supports Topic Filtering only applied to a single wildcard event.

## Accessing Contract State in Event Handlers

**File:** `Guides/contract-state.md`

> **Example Repository:** The complete code for this guide can be found here

## Introduction

This guide demonstrates how to access on-chain contract state from your event handlers. You'll learn how to:

1. Make RPC calls to external contracts within your event handlers
2. Batch multiple calls using multicall for efficiency
3. Implement caching to reduce redundant RPC requests
4. Handle common edge cases that arise when accessing token contract data

## The Challenge: Token Data from Pool Creation Events

### Scenario

We want to track token information (name, symbol, decimals) for every token involved in a Uniswap V3 pool creation event.

### Problem

The Uniswap V3 factory `PoolCreated` event only provides token addresses, not their metadata:



To get the token name, symbol, and decimals, we need to:

1. Extract the token addresses from the event
2. Make RPC calls to each token's contract
3. Store this data alongside our pool information

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes:

- Basic familiarity with Envio indexing
- Understanding of the viem library for making contract calls
- Access to an Ethereum RPC endpoint (dRPC recommended)

For a gentle introduction to viem with a similar example, check out this medium article.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Setup the Indexer Configuration

First, create a new indexer:



When prompted, enter the Ethereum mainnet Uniswap V3 Factory address: `0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984`

Then modify your configuration to focus only on the PoolCreated event:



> **Note**: We're starting at block 21,000,000 to reduce initial sync time, as RPC calls can be slow. See the Rate Limiting section for optimization strategies.

### Step 2: Define the Schema

Create a schema that captures both pool and token information:



### Step 3: Implement the Event Handler

The event handler needs to:

1. Create a Pool entity from the event data
2. Make RPC calls to fetch token information for both token0 and token1
3. Create Token entities with the retrieved data



> **Important:** The `hexToString` method from Viem adds byte padding to the string. We remove this padding with `replace(/\u0000/g, '')` to avoid errors when writing to the database.

### Step 5: Implement Caching

Caching is crucial for efficiency. Many pools share common tokens (like USDC, WETH, etc.), and we don't want to make redundant RPC calls for the same token addresses.



> **Note:** The hosted service supports basic JSON file caching in beta. Speak to the team if you want to discuss caching options.

### Step 6: Improve Performance with Loaders

The solution will perform external calls for each handler one by one. This is not efficient and can be improved with loaders. Read more about the Effect API and Loaders in the dedicated guides.

## Key Considerations

### Understanding Current vs. Historical State

Standard RPC requests return the **current state** of a contract, not the state at a specific historical block. For token metadata (name, symbol, decimals), this isn't typically an issue since these values rarely change.

However, if you need historical state (like an account balance at a specific block), you would need a specialized RPC method like eth_getBalanceAt.

### Handling Rate Limiting

RPC providers often limit the number of requests per time period. To avoid hitting rate limits:

1. **Use multicall** (as shown in our example) to batch multiple contract calls into a single RPC request
2. **Implement caching** to avoid redundant requests
3. **Use a paid, unthrottled RPC provider** for production indexers
4. **Implement request throttling** to space out requests when needed
5. **Use multiple RPC providers** and rotate between them for high-volume indexing

## Conclusion

Accessing contract state from your event handlers opens up powerful possibilities for enriching your indexed data. By following the patterns in this guide, you can efficiently retrieve and store contract state while maintaining good performance.

For more advanced techniques, explore:

- Implementing retry logic for failed RPC calls
- Handling complex contract interactions beyond basic ERC20 tokens

## Using HyperSync as Your Indexing Data Source

**File:** `Advanced/hypersync.md`

> **"Beam me up, Scotty!"** 🖖 — Just like the Star Trek transporter, HyperSync delivers your blockchain data at warp speed.

## What is HyperSync?

HyperSync is a purpose built data-node that helps powers the exceptional performance of HyperIndex. It's a specialized data source optimized for indexing that provides:

- **100x faster sync speeds** compared to traditional RPC methods
- **Cost-effective data retrieval** with optimized resource usage
- **Flexibility** with the ability to fetch multiple data points in a single round trip with more complex filtering

## How HyperSync Powers Your Indexers

### The Performance Advantage

Traditional blockchain indexing relies on RPC (Remote Procedure Call) endpoints to query blockchain data. While functional, RPCs become highly inefficient when:

- Indexing millions of events
- Processing historical blockchain data
- Extracting data across multiple networks
- Working with thousands of contracts

HyperSync addresses these limitations by providing a streamlined data access layer that dramatically reduces sync times from days to minutes.

### Default Enablement

**HyperSync is used by default** as the data source for all HyperIndex networks. This means:

- No additional configuration is required to benefit from its speed
- No need to worry about RPC rate limiting
- No management of multiple RPC providers
- No costs for external RPC services

## Using HyperSync in Your Projects

### Configuration

To use HyperSync (the default), simply don't set an RPC for historical sync in your config. HyperIndex will automatically use HyperSync for supported networks:



### Smart Block Detection

When using HyperSync, you can specify `start_block: 0` in your configuration. HyperSync will automatically:

1. Detect the first block where your contract was deployed
2. Begin indexing from that block
3. Skip unnecessary processing of earlier blocks

This feature eliminates the need to manually determine the deployment block of your contract, saving setup time and reducing configuration errors.

## Availability and Support

HyperSync is maintained and hosted by Envio for all supported networks. We handle the infrastructure, allowing you to focus on building your indexer logic.

### Improving resilience with RPC fallback

HyperIndex allows you to configure additional RPC providers as fallback data sources. This redundancy is **recommended** for production deployments to ensure continuous operation of your indexer. If HyperSync experiences any interruption, your indexer will automatically switch to the fallback RPC provider.

Adding an RPC fallback provides these benefits:

- **High availability**: Your indexer continues to function even during temporary HyperSync outages
- **Automatic failover**: The system detects issues and switches to fallback RPC without manual intervention
- **Operational control**: You can specify which RPC providers to use as fallbacks based on your requirements

Configure a fallback RPC by adding the `rpc` field to your network configuration:



:::info
This feature is available starting from version `2.14.0`. The fallback RPC is activated only when a primary data source doesn't receive a new block for more than 20 seconds.
:::

### Supported Networks

HyperSync supports numerous EVM networks including Ethereum, Unichain, Arbitrum, Optimism, and more. For a complete and up-to-date list of supported networks, see the HyperSync Supported Networks documentation.

### Alternatives

HyperSync data source is vendorlock-free. While HyperSync is recommended for optimal performance, you can always switch to RPCs without the need to change your indexer code. For information on configuring RPC-based indexing, visit the RPC Data Source documentation.

## Performance Comparison

| Metric             | Traditional RPC       | HyperSync                    |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Indexing 1M Events | Hours to days         | Minutes                      |

## Using RPC as Your Indexing Data Source

**File:** `Advanced/rpc-sync.md`

HyperIndex supports indexing any EVM blockchain using RPC (Remote Procedure Call) as the data source. This page explains when and how to use RPC for your indexing needs.

## When to Use RPC

While HyperSync is the recommended and default data source for optimal performance, there are scenarios where you might need to use RPC instead:

1. **Unsupported Networks**: When indexing a blockchain network that isn't yet supported by HyperSync
2. **Custom Requirements**: When you need specific RPC functionality not available in HyperSync
3. **Private Chains**: When working with private or development EVM chains

> **Note**: For networks that HyperSync supports, we strongly recommend using HyperSync rather than RPC. HyperSync provides significantly faster indexing performance (up to 100x) and doesn't require managing RPC endpoints or worrying about rate limits.

## Configuring RPC in Your Indexer

### Basic Configuration

To use RPC as your data source, you need to add an `rpc_config` section to your network configuration in the `config.yaml` file:



The presence of the `rpc_config` section tells HyperIndex to use RPC instead of HyperSync for this network.

### Advanced RPC Configuration

For more control over how your indexer interacts with the RPC endpoint, you can configure additional parameters:



### Configuration Parameters Explained

| Parameter                | Description                                | Recommended Value   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| `url`                    | Your RPC endpoint URL                      | Depends on provider |
| `initial_block_interval` | Starting block batch size                  | 1,000 - 10,000      |
| `backoff_multiplicative` | How much to reduce batch size after errors | 0.5 - 0.9           |
| `acceleration_additive`  | How much to increase batch size on success | 500 - 2,000         |
| `interval_ceiling`       | Maximum blocks per request                 | 5,000 - 10,000      |
| `backoff_millis`         | Wait time after errors (ms)                | 1,000 - 10,000      |
| `query_timeout_millis`   | Request timeout (ms)                       | 10,000 - 30,000     |

The optimal values depend on your RPC provider's performance and limits, as well as the complexity of your contracts and the data being indexed.

## RPC Best Practices

### Selecting an RPC Provider

When choosing an RPC provider, consider:

- **Rate limits**: Most providers have limits on requests per second/minute
- **Node performance**: Some providers offer faster nodes for premium tiers
- **Archive nodes**: Required if you need historical state (e.g., balances at past blocks)
- **Geographic location**: Choose nodes closest to your indexer deployment

### Performance Optimization

To get the best performance when using RPC:

1. **Start from a recent block** if possible, rather than indexing from genesis
2. **Tune batch parameters** based on your provider's capabilities
3. **Use a paid service** for better reliability and higher rate limits
4. **Consider multiple fallback RPCs** for redundancy

## Enhanced RPC with eRPC

For more robust RPC usage, you can implement eRPC - a fault-tolerant EVM RPC proxy with advanced features like caching and failover.

### What eRPC Provides

- **Permanent caching**: Stores historical responses to reduce redundant requests
- **Auto failover**: Automatically switches between multiple RPC providers
- **Re-org awareness**: Properly handles blockchain reorganizations
- **Auto-batching**: Optimizes requests to minimize network overhead
- **Load balancing**: Distributes requests across multiple providers

### Setting Up eRPC

1. **Create your eRPC configuration file** (`erpc.yaml`):



2. **Run eRPC using Docker**:



Or add it to your existing Docker Compose setup:



3. **Configure HyperIndex to use eRPC** in your `config.yaml`:



For more detailed configuration options, refer to the eRPC documentation.

## Comparing HyperSync and RPC

| Cost            | Included with Hosted Service                                       | Pay per request/subscription |
| Network Support | Supported networks | Any EVM network              |
| Maintenance     | Managed by Envio                                                   | Self-managed                 |

## Summary

While RPC provides the flexibility to index any EVM blockchain, it comes with performance limitations and configuration complexity. For supported networks, we recommend using HyperSync as your data source for optimal performance.

If you must use RPC:

- Choose a reliable provider
- Configure your indexer for optimal performance
- Consider implementing eRPC for enhanced reliability and performance
- Start from recent blocks when possible to reduce indexing time

For any questions about using RPC with HyperIndex, please contact the Envio team.

## Indexing IPFS Data with Envio

**File:** `Guides/ipfs.md`

> **Example Repository:** The complete code for this guide can be found here
>
> **Important Note:** The example repository contains a SQLite caching implementation which is **not supported** on the Envio hosted service. This guide has been updated to exclude the SQLite implementation, focusing only on approaches compatible with the hosted environment.

## Introduction

This guide demonstrates how to fetch and index data stored on IPFS within your Envio indexer. We'll use the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection as a practical example, showing you how to retrieve and store token metadata from IPFS.

IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is commonly used in blockchain applications to store larger data like images and metadata that would be prohibitively expensive to store on-chain. By integrating IPFS fetching capabilities into your indexers, you can provide a more complete data model that combines on-chain events with off-chain metadata.

## Implementation Overview

Our implementation will follow these steps:

1. Create a basic indexer for Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT transfers
2. Extend the indexer to fetch and store metadata from IPFS
3. Handle IPFS connection issues with fallback gateways

## Step 1: Setting Up the Basic NFT Indexer

First, let's create a basic indexer that tracks NFT ownership:

### Initialize the Indexer



When prompted, enter the Bored Ape Yacht Club contract address: `0xBC4CA0EdA7647A8aB7C2061c2E118A18a936f13D`

### Configure the Indexer

Modify the configuration to focus on the Transfer events:



### Define the Schema

Create a schema to store NFT ownership data:



### Implement the Event Handler

Track ownership changes by handling Transfer events:



Run your indexer with `pnpm dev` and visit http://localhost:8080 to see the ownership data:

!Basic NFT ownership data

## Step 2: Fetching IPFS Metadata

Now, let's enhance our indexer to fetch metadata from IPFS:

### Update the Schema

Extend the schema to include metadata fields:



### Create IPFS Utility Functions

Create a new file to handle IPFS requests with fallbacks to multiple gateways:



> **Note:** For production indexers, the Envio hosted service automatically handles optimizations. You should not implement persistent file-based caching mechanisms as they are not supported in the hosted environment. Please discuss with the team your options regarding caching.
>
> **Important:** While the example repository includes SQLite-based caching, this approach is not compatible with the Envio hosted service and should not be used for production deployments.

### 4. Improve Performance with Loaders

The solution will perform external calls for each handler one by one. This is not efficient and can be improved with loaders. Read more about the Effect API and Loaders in the dedicated guides.

## Understanding IPFS

### What is IPFS?

IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data. It works by:

1. Splitting files into chunks
2. Creating content-addressed identifiers (CIDs) based on the content itself
3. Distributing these chunks across a network of nodes
4. Retrieving data based on its CID rather than its location

### Common Use Cases with Smart Contracts

IPFS is frequently used alongside smart contracts for:

- **NFTs**: Storing images, videos, and metadata while the contract manages ownership
- **Decentralized Identity Systems**: Storing credential documents and personal information
- **DAOs**: Maintaining governance documents, proposals, and organizational assets
- **dApps**: Hosting front-end interfaces and application assets

### IPFS Challenges

IPFS integration comes with several challenges:

1. **Slow Retrieval Times**: IPFS data can be slow to retrieve, especially for less widely replicated content
2. **Gateway Reliability**: Public gateways can be inconsistent in their availability
3. **Data Persistence**: Content may become unavailable if nodes stop hosting it

To mitigate these issues:

- Use pinning services like Pinata or Infura to ensure data persistence
- Implement multiple gateway fallbacks
- Consider paid gateways for production applications

## Migration Guide: HyperIndex v1 to v2

**File:** `migration-guide-v1-v2.md`

## Introduction

Welcome to HyperIndex v2 - a major upgrade that significantly enhances your indexing experience! This new version introduces asynchronous processing, streamlined workflows, and improved flexibility for your indexers. With v2, you'll benefit from faster development, better performance, and a more intuitive API.

While the full release changes can be found in the v2.0.0 release notes, here are some key highlights before we dive into the comprehensive migration guide:

- Handlers are now asynchronous, with `loaders` becoming an optional tool for additional optimizations.
- Async-mode has been removed as it's no longer needed in v2.
- Loaders (when used) are more expressive and directly connected to the handler context via their return type.
  - In v2, you can access loader fields in the handler the same way you do in the loader, using an async 'get' function.
  - The return type of the loader can be used to directly access loaded data in the handler via the context.
- Indexing parameters with names that are reserved words in ReScript have been fixed.
- Validation and autocompletion for `config.yaml` is now available. Enable it by adding `# yaml-language-server: $schema=./node_modules/envio/evm.schema.json` at the top of your `config.yaml` file.

These changes simplify the development process and provide a more consistent and powerful indexing experience. The following sections will guide you through the necessary steps to migrate your existing v1 indexers to v2.

## Changes to Make

### Handlers

- Handlers are now asynchronous - add the `async` keyword and rename `handlerAsync` to `handler`.
- You can use `handlerWithLoader` if you need a loader, otherwise, use `handler` directly.
- The 'get' function is now asynchronous, so add an `await` before those functions.
- No labeled entities.

### Loaders

- Loaders are merged into the handlers using `handlerWithLoader`.
- Loading linked entities is done directly with promises in the loader.
- Loaders are completely optional - only use the if you care about high throughput indexing.
- Loaders return the required entities which are then used in the handler.
- The dynamic contract registration moved from loaders to its own `..contractRegister` handler.
- The return type of the loader is used directly in the handler to access the loaded data. No need to re-'get' it again in the handler.

### Configuration

- There is no async-mode anymore, so you can remove `isAsync: true` from each of the events in your `config.yaml`.
- There is no more 'required_entities' in the config file. This includes sub-fields such as `label` and `arrayLabels`.



- Removed entity labels and required entities.



#### Field Selection and Event Parameter Changes

In v2, the structure of the `event` parameter has changed significantly. Some fields have been moved or renamed, and new fields are available through the `field_selection` configuration.

Field selection allows you to add additional data points to each event that gets passed to your handlers. This feature enhances the flexibility and efficiency of your indexer, as by default you don't fetch data that isn't required.

To use field selection, add a `field_selection` section to your `config.yaml` file. For example:



For an exhaustive list of fields that can be added and more detailed information about field selection, please refer to the Field Selection section in the Configuration File guide.

Note: By default, `number`, `hash`, and `timestamp` are already selected for `block_fields` and do not need to be configured.

#### 'event' Parameter Changes

The structure of the `event` parameter has changed in v2. This affects loaders, handlers, and dynamic contract registration. Here are the key changes:

1. Block and transaction fields are now scoped under `event.block` and `event.transaction` respectively.
2. Some field names have changed:
   - `event.txOrigin` is now `event.transaction.from` (requires adding to config)
   - `event.txTo` is now `event.transaction.to` (requires adding to config)
   - `event.txHash` is now `event.transaction.hash` (requires adding to config)
   - `event.blockTimestamp` is now `event.block.timestamp` (no config change)
   - `event.blockNumber` is now `event.block.number` (no config change)
   - `event.blockHash` is now `event.block.hash` (no config change)

### Miscellaneous breaking changes and deprecations

- The `context.Entity.load` function is deprecated and should be replaced with direct calls to `context.Entity.get` in the loader.
- The `context.ParentEntity.loadField` functions are deprecated and should be replaced with direct calls to `context.ChildEntity.get`.
- Remove the `Contract` and `Entity` suffixes from the generated code.
- For JavaScript/TypeScript users:
  - The event param names are not uncapitalized anymore. So you might need to change `event.params.capitalizedParamName` to `event.params.CapitalizedParamName`.
- For ReScript users:
  - We moved to the built-in `bigint` type instead of the `Ethers.BigInt.t`.
  - We migrated to ReScript 11 uncurried mode. Curried mode is not supported anymore. So you need to remove `uncurried: false` from your rescript.json file. Also, we vendored `RescriptMocha` bindings to support uncurried mode. Please use it instead of `rescript-mocha`.
- The config parsing is more strict, unknown fields will result in an error.
  - You can add `# yaml-language-server: $schema=./node_modules/envio/evm.schema.json` at the top of your 'config.yaml' file to get autocomplete and validation for the config file.

## Migration Steps

### 1. Update Imports

Replace the old import statements with the new ones.

**Before:**



### 3. Dynamic Contract Registration

Use `contractRegister` for dynamic contract registration. Assuming there is an event called NewGreeterCreated that creates a contract called Greeter that has the address of the `newGreeter` as a field.

**Before:**



**After:**



### 4. Handling Entities

**Before**



**After**



The only change is in the TypeScript/ReScript type for the entity 💪

### 5. Accessing Loaded Data

**After:**



#### Access loaded data through the `loaderReturn` if you are using loaders:

**Before:**



**After:**



### 6. Loading Linked Entities

After (v2):



And in your `config.yaml` file:



## Examples

As we upgrade public repos on GitHub, we'll add the commits of the upgrade to this page for reference:

- Velodrome Indexer Upgrade Commit

### Additional Tips

- Make sure to thoroughly test your migrated code to catch any issues that might arise from the asynchronous nature of the new handlers.

- If performance isn't a massive concern, you can simply use the `handler` function without a loader.

## Understanding and Handling Chain Reorganizations

**File:** `Advanced/reorgs-support.md`

## What Are Chain Reorganizations?

Chain reorganizations (reorgs) occur when the blockchain temporarily forks and then resolves to a single chain, causing some previously confirmed blocks to be replaced by different blocks. This is a normal part of blockchain consensus mechanisms, especially in proof-of-work chains.

When a reorg happens:

- Transactions that were previously considered confirmed may be dropped
- New transactions may be added to the blockchain
- The order of transactions might change

For indexers, this presents a challenge: data that was previously indexed may no longer be valid, requiring a rollback and reprocessing of the affected blocks.

## Automatic Reorg Handling in HyperIndex

HyperIndex includes built-in support for handling chain reorganizations, ensuring your indexed data remains consistent with the blockchain's canonical state. This feature is **enabled by default** to protect your data integrity.

## Configuration Options

### Enabling or Disabling Reorg Support

You can control reorg handling through the `rollback_on_reorg` flag in your `config.yaml` file:



### Configuring Confirmation Thresholds

You can customize the number of blocks required before considering a block "confirmed" and no longer subject to reorgs:



The `confirmed_block_threshold` defines how many blocks below the chain head are considered safe from reorganizations. Any reorg deeper than this threshold won't trigger a rollback in your indexer.

## Default Confirmation Thresholds

Currently, all chains default to a threshold of **200 blocks**. In future releases, these thresholds will be tailored per chain based on their specific characteristics and historical reorg depths.

| Network Type | Default Threshold | Notes                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| All Networks | 200 blocks        | Will be customized per chain in future releases |

## Technical Details and Limitations

### Guaranteed Detection

Reorg detection is guaranteed when using HyperSync as your data source. HyperSync's architecture ensures that any reorganization in the blockchain will be properly detected and handled.

### RPC Limitations

When using a custom RPC endpoint as your data source, there are some edge cases where reorgs might go undetected, depending on the RPC provider's implementation and your indexing pattern.

### Scope of Rollbacks

During a reorg-triggered rollback:

✅ **What is rolled back:**

- All entities defined in your schema
- All data that your handlers read or write to the database

❌ **What is not rolled back:**

- Side effects in your handler code (API calls, external services)
- Custom caching mechanisms outside of HyperIndex
- Logs or external files written by your handlers

## Best Practices

1. **Keep reorg support enabled** for production indexers
2. **Use HyperSync** when possible for guaranteed reorg detection
3. **Avoid external side effects** in your handlers that cannot be rolled back
4. **Consider higher thresholds** for high-value applications or networks with historically deep reorgs

## Example Configuration

Here's a complete example showing reorg handling configuration for multiple networks:



By properly configuring reorg support, you ensure that your indexed data remains consistent with the blockchain, even when the chain reorganizes.

## Understanding Generated Indexing Files

**File:** `Advanced/generated-files.md`

## Overview

The `/generated` directory contains files automatically created by Envio's code generation system. These files form the backbone of your indexer's runtime operations, translating your configuration, schema, and event handlers into executable code that processes blockchain data.

> **Important:** Generated files should never be manually edited. Any changes will be overwritten the next time code generation runs.

## Purpose of Generated Files

Generated files serve several critical functions:

1. **Type-Safe Data Access** - They provide strongly-typed interfaces to interact with your defined entities
2. **Event Processing** - They contain the logic to decode and process contract events
3. **Database Interactions** - They manage database operations for storing and retrieving indexed data
4. **Runtime Orchestration** - They coordinate the indexing workflow

## Real-World Example: Uniswap V4 Indexer

Let's examine how specific elements from a real Uniswap V4 indexer translate into generated files:

### From Schema to Generated Types

For a schema entity like this:



The codegen process generates:

1. **Type Definition** in `EntityModels.res`:

   

2. **Constructor Function**:

   

3. **Database Functions** in `Queries.res`:

   

### From Config to Generated Event Handlers

Given a contract event in `config.yaml`:



The codegen process generates handler wrappers like:



### From Multi-Network Config to Generated Network Handlers

Your config has multiple networks:



The generated code will include configuration parsing that handles all three networks:



## When to Run Code Generation

You should run code generation using the Envio CLI whenever you:



Codegen should be run after:

1. Modifying your `config.yaml` file
2. Changing your GraphQL schema
3. Adding or updating event handlers
4. Switching to a new contract or ABI
5. After pulling changes from version control

## Troubleshooting Generation Errors

When code generation fails, the errors typically point to issues in your setup files. Here are common error patterns and their solutions:

### Configuration Errors

Error messages containing `Config validation failed` typically mean there's an issue in your `config.yaml` file:

- Check for syntax errors in YAML formatting
- Verify that all required fields are present
- Ensure contract addresses are in the correct format
- Confirm that referenced networks are valid

For example, if you see an error about invalid network IDs, check that all network IDs in your config are valid:



### Schema Errors

Errors mentioning `Schema parsing error` point to issues in your GraphQL schema:

- Check for invalid GraphQL syntax
- Ensure entity names match those referenced in handlers
- Verify that relationships between entities are properly defined
- Check for unsupported types or directives

For example, if you're using the `@index` directive as in your `Pool` entity's `numberOfSwaps` field, make sure it's correctly placed:



### Handler Errors

If you see `Handler validation failed` errors:

- Check that handler function signatures match expected patterns
- Ensure all referenced entities exist in your schema
- Verify proper import syntax for entities and contract events

## Relationship with Setup Files

The generated files directly reflect the structure defined in your setup files:

- **config.yaml** → Determines which networks, contracts, and events are indexed
- **schema.graphql** → Defines the entities and relationships that are generated
- **EventHandlers** → Provides the business logic that the generated code wraps

## Best Practices

1. **Never modify generated files directly** - Always change the source files
2. **Run codegen before starting your indexer** - Ensure all files are up to date
3. **Check error messages carefully** - They often pinpoint issues in your setup files

## Summary

Generated files form the critical bridge between your indexing specifications and the actual runtime execution. While you shouldn't modify them directly, understanding their structure and purpose can help you debug issues and optimize your indexing process.

If you encounter persistent errors in generated files, ensure your configuration, schema, and handlers follow Envio's best practices, or contact support for assistance.

## HyperIndex Terminology & Key Concepts

**File:** `Advanced/terminology.md`

This comprehensive glossary explains the key terms and concepts used throughout the Envio documentation and ecosystem. Terms are organized by category for easier reference.

## Table of Contents

- Blockchain Fundamentals
- Smart Contract Concepts
- Indexing & Data
- Development Tools
- Programming Languages
- Envio Platform
- Mathematical Concepts

## Blockchain Fundamentals

### Address

A unique identifier representing an account or entity within a blockchain network. Addresses are typically represented as hexadecimal strings (e.g., `0x1234...abcd`) and used to send, receive, or interact with blockchain resources.

### Block

A collection of data containing a set of transactions that are bundled together and added to the blockchain. Blocks are linked together chronologically to form the blockchain.

### EVM

**Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** is a runtime environment that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a sandboxed and deterministic execution environment for smart contract code.

### EVM Compatible

The ability for a blockchain to run the EVM and execute Ethereum smart contracts. In the context of Envio, it's the ability to deploy a unified API to retrieve data from multiple EVM-compatible blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, BSC, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Optimism, Fantom, Cronos, etc.).

### Node

A device or computer that participates in a blockchain network, maintaining a copy of the blockchain and validating transactions.

### Transaction

An action or set of actions recorded on the blockchain, typically involving the transfer of assets, execution of smart contracts, or other network interactions. Once confirmed, transactions become a permanent part of the blockchain.

## Smart Contract Concepts

### Event

A specific occurrence or action within a blockchain system that is specified in smart contracts and used to emit data from the blockchain. Smart contracts can emit events to essentially communicate that something has happened on the blockchain.

Web applications or any kind of application (e.g., mobile app, backend job, etc.) can listen to events and take actions when they occur. Events are typically data that are not stored on-chain as it would be considerably more expensive to store.

**Example:**

Declaring an event:



Emitting an event:



### Event Handler

A function that listens for a specific event from a smart contract and either updates or inserts new data into your Envio API. Event handlers define the business logic for processing blockchain events.

### Smart Contract

A self-executing program with the terms of an agreement directly written into code that runs on the blockchain. Smart contracts are not controlled by a user but are deployed to the network and run as programmed. User accounts can interact with smart contracts by submitting transactions that execute defined functions.

### Tokens

Digital representations of assets or utilities within a blockchain system that follow a specific standard. Common token standards include:

- **ERC-20**: Standard for fungible tokens (identical and interchangeable)
- **ERC-721**: Standard for non-fungible tokens (unique and non-interchangeable)
- **ERC-1155**: Multi-token standard supporting both fungible and non-fungible tokens

## Indexing & Data

### API

**Application Programming Interface** is a set of protocols and tools for building software applications. APIs define how different software components should interact with each other.

### Endpoint

A URL that can be used to query an Envio custom API. Endpoints provide a structured way to request specific data from the indexer.

### GraphQL

A query language for interacting with APIs, commonly used in blockchain systems for retrieving specific data from blockchain platforms. As an alternative to REST, GraphQL lets developers construct requests that pull data from multiple data sources in a single API call.

### GraphQL API

The data presentation part of an Envio indexer. Typically, it's a GraphQL API auto-generated from the schema file, allowing flexible and efficient data queries.

### Indexer

A specialized database management system (DBMS) that indexes and organizes blockchain data, making it easier for developers to efficiently query, retrieve, and utilize on-chain data.

Web2 apps usually rely on indexers like Google to pre-sort information into indices for data retrieval and filtering. In blockchain and Web3, applications need indexers to achieve similar data retrieval capabilities.

### Query

A request for data. In the context of Envio, a query is a request for data from an Envio API that will be answered by an Envio Indexer.

### Schema File

A file that defines entities based on events emitted from smart contracts and specifies the data types for these entities. The schema serves as the blueprint for your indexed data structure.

## Development Tools

### Codegen

The process of automatically generating code based on a given input. In blockchain development, codegen is often used for generating client libraries, interfaces, or type-safe data access layers from schemas or specifications.

### Envio CLI

A command line interface tool for building and deploying Envio indexers. The CLI provides commands for initializing, developing, and managing your indexer projects.

### SDK

**Software Development Kit** is a collection of tools, libraries, and documentation that facilitates the development of applications for a specific platform or system.

## Programming Languages

### JavaScript

A high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for client-side scripting in web browsers. It is the de facto language for web development, enabling developers to create interactive and dynamic web applications.

### ReScript

A robustly typed language that compiles to efficient and human-readable JavaScript. ReScript aims to bring the power and expressiveness of functional programming to JavaScript development. It offers seamless integration with JavaScript and provides features like static typing, pattern matching, and immutable data structures.

### TypeScript

A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other advanced features to the language. It compiles down to plain JavaScript, making it compatible with existing JavaScript codebases. TypeScript helps developers catch errors during development by providing type-checking and improved tooling support. It enhances JavaScript by adding features like interfaces, classes, modules, and generics.

## Envio Platform

### Hosted Service

A managed service platform for building, hosting, and querying Envio's Indexers with guaranteed uptime and performance service level agreements. The Hosted Service removes the operational burden of running indexers.

### Ploffen

Ploffen (meaning "Pop" in Dutch) is a fun game based on an ERC20 token contract, where users can deposit a game token (i.e., make a contribution) into a savings pool.

The last user to add a contribution to the savings pool has a chance of winning the entire pool if no other user deposits a contribution within 1 hour of the previous contribution. For example, if 30 persons play the game, and each person contributes a small amount, the last person can win the _total contributions_ made by all 30 persons in the savings pool.

The Ploffen project demonstrates a Hardhat framework example. It includes a sample contract, a test for that contract, a deployment script, and the Envio integration to index emitted events from the Ploffen smart contract.

## Mathematical Concepts

### Commutative Property

A fundamental property of certain binary operations in mathematics. An operation is said to be commutative if the order in which you apply the operation to two operands does not affect the result. In other words, for a commutative operation:

a + b = b + a

**Examples of commutative operations:**

1. **Addition**: 2 + 3 = 3 + 2
2. **Multiplication**: 2 _ 3 = 3 _ 2

**Examples of non-commutative operations:**

1. **Subtraction**: 5 - 3 ≠ 3 - 5
2. **Division**: 8 / 4 ≠ 4 / 8
3. **String Concatenation**: "Hello" + "World" ≠ "World" + "Hello"

The commutative property is a property of the operation itself, not necessarily the numbers involved. If an operation is commutative, you can switch the order of the operands without changing the result.

## Optimizing Database Access with Loaders

**File:** `Advanced/loaders.md`

## What Are Loaders?

Loaders are specialized functions that dramatically optimize how your event handlers fetch data from the database. They provide a powerful mechanism to:

- **Batch multiple database requests** into single operations
- **Cache database results** in memory for instant access
- **Reduce I/O operations**, which are typically the primary performance bottleneck in indexing

By using loaders, you can reduce database roundtrips from thousands to just a handful, especially when processing large batches of events.

## Why Use Loaders?

### The Database I/O Problem

Consider this common pattern in event handlers:



**The Performance Challenge:** If you're processing 5,000 transfer events, each with unique `from` and `to` addresses, this results in **10,000 total database roundtrips**—one for each sender and receiver lookup (2 per event × 5,000 events). This creates a significant bottleneck that slows down your entire indexing process.

### The External Calls Problem

To ensure consistent and reliable data, all handlers execute synchronously in on-chain order. This means external calls can dramatically increase processing time:



**The Performance Challenge:** If you're processing 5,000 transfer events, each with an external call, this results in **5,000 sequential external calls**—each waiting for the previous one to complete. This can turn a fast indexing process into a slow, sequential crawl.

### How Loaders Solve This

Loaders address these performance bottlenecks through intelligent optimization:

1. **Collect all database and Effect requests** before processing events
2. **Batch similar requests** into single I/O operations
3. **Cache results** in memory for efficient reuse

This approach reduces thousands of database calls to just a handful per batch, dramatically improving indexing performance. When combined with the Effect API, you can also parallelize external calls for even greater efficiency.

## How to Implement Loaders

### Basic Structure

Loaders use the `handlerWithLoader` pattern, which elegantly separates data loading from event processing:



### Basic Example: Converting a Simple Handler

Let's convert our previous inefficient example to use loaders:



### How Batching Works

The batching process follows these three key steps:

1. **Batch Creation**: HyperIndex creates an ordered batch of events from the event buffer accumulated in memory
2. **Preload Phase**: All loader functions run concurrently for the entire batch. This is called the `Preload` phase.

   _**Note:** During the preload phase, some entities being loaded may not exist yet since the handlers haven't been executed. This is expected behavior - the loader runs twice per event to ensure data consistency._

3. **Sequential Processing**: For each event in the batch, its loader runs a **second time** and then passes the result to the handler. This step is sequential to maintain order.

For our 5,000 transfer events example, this reduces database roundtrips from 10,000 total calls to just 2!

## Advanced Loader Techniques

### Optimizing for Concurrency

You can further optimize performance by requesting multiple entities concurrently:



This approach can reduce the database roundtrips to just 1 for the entire batch of events!

### Querying by Field Values

Loaders also support complex queries using the `getWhere` method, which allows you to retrieve arrays of entities based on field values:



This technique works with any entity field that:

- Is used in a relationship with the `@derivedFrom` directive
- Has an `@index` directive

## Effect API `experimental`

The Effect API provides a powerful and convenient way to perform external calls from your handlers. It's especially effective when used with loaders:

- **Automatic batching**: Calls of the same kind are automatically batched together
- **Intelligent memoization**: Calls are memoized, so you don't need to worry about the handler function being called multiple times
- **Deduplication**: Calls with the same arguments are deduplicated to prevent overfetching
- **Future enhancements**: We're working on automatic retry logic and result persistence for indexer reruns 🏗️

To use the Effect API, you first need to define an effect using `experimental_createEffect` function from the `envio` package:



The first argument is an options object that describes the effect:

- `name` (required) - the name of the effect used for debugging and logging
- `input` (required) - the input type of the effect
- `output` (required) - the output type of the effect

The second argument is a function that will be called with the effect's input.

> **Note:** For type definitions, you should use `S` from the `envio` package, which uses Sury library under the hood.

After defining an effect, you can use `context.effect` to call it from your handler, loader, or another effect.

The `context.effect` function accepts an effect as the first argument and the effect's input as the second argument:



This way for our problem of 5,000 transfer events, we will be able to parallelize all external calls instead of executing them one by one.

### Viem Pro Tip

You can use `viem` or any other blockchain client inside your effect functions. When doing so, it's highly recommended to enable the `batch` option to group all effect calls into fewer RPC requests:



### Why Experimental?

The Effect API is currently marked as experimental, but we don't expect breaking changes in the future. This designation simply means we're actively iterating on the feature and may add new capabilities that could subtly change indexer behavior. We plan to remove the `experimental` tag soon, and your feedback is invaluable in this process!

## Best Practices

### When to Use Loaders

Loaders provide the most significant benefits when:

- Processing large batches of events that require similar database lookups
- Reading the same entities multiple times across different events
- Performing relationship queries that affect multiple entities
- Building high-performance indexers that need to handle millions of events

### Performance Considerations

When using loaders, keep these performance factors in mind:

- **Memory Usage**: All loaded entities are stored in memory during batch processing
- **Query Size**: Very large `getWhere` queries might cause memory issues
- **Complexity**: Balance the benefits of batching against code complexity
- **Batch Size**: Larger batches provide better performance but use more memory

### Rules of Thumb

Follow these guidelines for optimal loader usage:

1. **Use loaders for large-scale indexing**: Implement loaders if you're indexing more than 1 million events
2. **Centralize database operations**: Put all database operations in the loader function
3. **Wrap external calls in effects**: Use the Effect API for external calls and implement them in loaders
4. **Keep handlers focused**: Reserve handler functions for business logic, not data fetching
5. **Optimize with concurrency**: Use concurrent requests when loading multiple unrelated entities
6. **Monitor memory usage**: Be mindful of memory consumption with large batches

### Understanding Double Run Behavior

Loaders are designed to run twice per event to ensure data consistency across the batch. This is intentional and expected behavior:

1. **First Run (Preload Phase)**: All loaders run concurrently at the start of batch processing
2. **Second Run (Event Processing)**: Each loader runs again sequentially before its corresponding handler

This double execution pattern ensures that:

- Entities created by earlier events in the batch are available to later events
- Data consistency is maintained across the entire batch
- The benefits of batching are preserved while ensuring accurate data access



The indexer will only crash if the `sender` entity was actually not set in an event preceding the one being processed, which indicates a genuine data consistency issue.

### Preload Phase Behavior

Starting from `envio@2.23.0`, the preload phase has been enhanced to prevent batch processing failures. During the first run (preload phase), the following operations are silently ignored:

- **Thrown exceptions**: Any errors thrown during the preload phase are caught and ignored
- **Entity setting**: Calls to `context.Entity.set()` and other entity operations are ignored during preload
- **Logging**: Calls to `context.log.*()` are ignored during preload

Only during the second run (actual event processing) are all operations fully enabled:

- Exceptions will crash the indexer if not handled
- Entity setting operations will persist to the database
- Logging will output to the console

This design ensures that the preload phase can safely attempt to load data that may not exist yet, while the actual processing phase handles all operations normally.

If you're using an earlier version of `envio`, we strongly recommend upgrading to the latest version with `pnpm install envio@latest` to take advantage of this improved preload phase behavior.

### Going All-In with Loaders

Starting from `envio@2.23.0`, loaders support setting entities directly, making handlers optional. You can now process all your events entirely within the loader function:



**For power users, we recommend moving all event processing to the loader function** to take advantage of this enhanced functionality. This approach will be the most compatible with future Envio versions.

If you need to skip the preload phase for CPU-intensive operations or to perform certain actions only once, you can use `context.isPreload`. This allows you to replicate the traditional handler behavior within a loader.

**Note:** While `context.isPreload` can be useful for bypassing double execution, it's recommended to use the Effect API for external calls instead, as it provides automatic batching and memoization benefits.

### Future: Version 3.0 Unified Handler Behavior

In Envio V3, the separation between handlers and loaders will be removed entirely. All handlers will behave like loaders by default, running twice per event to ensure data consistency. This change will:

- **Make many indexers faster by default** without requiring explicit configuration
- **Simplify the mental model** (similar to React's double-render pattern)
- **Provide the benefits of loaders** without requiring explicit configuration

The double execution pattern should be familiar to JavaScript/React developers and will be thoroughly documented to help users understand this new behavior.

## Summary

Loaders provide a powerful and efficient way to optimize database access in your Envio indexers by:

- **Dramatically reducing database roundtrips** from thousands to just a few per batch
- **Automatically batching similar requests** for maximum efficiency
- **Caching results in memory** for instant access during processing

By elegantly separating data loading from event processing, loaders enable you to build more efficient and performant indexers while maintaining clean, readable code. Whether you're processing thousands or millions of events, loaders can transform your indexing performance from slow and sequential to fast and parallel.

## Optimizing Database Performance in HyperIndex

**File:** `Advanced/performance/database-performance-optimization.md`

## Introduction

As your indexed data grows, database performance becomes critical to maintaining responsive queries and efficient operations. This guide explains how to optimize your HyperIndex database through strategic indexing and schema design to ensure your applications remain fast even as data volume increases.

## Understanding Database Indices

Database indices are special data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations. Think of them like the index at the back of a book — rather than scanning every page (row) to find what you're looking for, indices allow the database to quickly locate the relevant data.

### Why Indices Matter

Without proper indices, your database must perform "full table scans" when searching for data, examining every row to find matches. As your data grows, this becomes increasingly inefficient:

| Data Size          | Without Indices | With Proper Indices |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------- |
| 1,000 records      | ~10ms           | ~1ms                |
| 100,000 records    | ~500ms          | ~2ms                |
| 1,000,000+ records | 5+ seconds      | ~5ms                |

_Note: Actual performance varies based on hardware, query complexity, and database load._

## Creating Custom Indices in Your Schema

HyperIndex provides several ways to define indices in your GraphQL schema, giving you control over database performance.

### Single-Column Indices

The simplest form of indexing is on individual fields using the `@index` directive:



In this example:

- Queries filtering on `userAddress` (e.g., finding all transactions for a user)
- Queries filtering on `tokenAddress` (e.g., finding all transactions for a token)
- Queries filtering on `timestamp` (e.g., finding transactions in a date range)

All become significantly faster because the database can use the indices to quickly locate matching records.

### Composite Indices for Multi-Field Queries

When you frequently query using multiple fields together, composite indices provide better performance:



This creates:

1. Individual indices on `from` and `to` fields
2. A composite index on the combination of `from`, `to`, and `tokenId`

Composite indices are particularly valuable for complex queries that filter on multiple columns simultaneously, such as "find all transfers from address X to address Y for token Z."

### Automatic Indices

HyperIndex automatically creates indices for:

- All `ID` fields
- All fields marked with `@derivedFrom`

There's no need to manually add indices for these fields.

## Strategic Indexing: When to Use Each Type

### When to Use Single-Column Indices

Use single-column indices when:

- You frequently filter by a specific field
- You sort results by a specific field
- The field has high "cardinality" (many different values)

**Example use case**: Indexing `userAddress` in a transaction table when users frequently look up their transaction history.

### When to Use Composite Indices

Use composite indices when:

- You frequently query using multiple fields together
- Your queries consistently filter on the same combination of fields
- You need to optimize complex queries with multiple conditions

**Example use case**: Indexing `(tokenAddress, timestamp)` together when users frequently view token transaction history within specific time ranges.

## Performance Tradeoffs

While indices improve query performance, they come with tradeoffs:

### Write Performance Impact

Each index requires additional updates when data is inserted or modified:

- **No indices**: Fastest write performance, but slow reads
- **Few targeted indices**: Slight write slowdown (5-10%), much faster reads
- **Many indices**: Noticeable write slowdown (15%+), fastest possible reads

For most applications, the read performance benefits outweigh the write performance costs, especially since blockchain data is primarily read-intensive.

### Storage Considerations

Indices increase database storage requirements:

- Each index typically requires 2-10 bytes per row
- For large datasets (millions of records), this can add up
- Consider storage requirements when designing indices for very large tables

## Practical Examples

### Optimizing Token Transfer Queries

Consider a token transfer entity:



With this schema, the following queries will be optimized:

- Find all transfers for a specific token
- Find all transfers from a specific address
- Find all transfers to a specific address
- Find transfers within a specific block range
- Find transfers within a specific time range

### Optimizing Complex NFT Marketplace Queries

For an NFT marketplace with listings and sales:



This schema efficiently supports:

- Finding all active listings for a collection, sorted by price
- Finding all listings by a specific seller with a specific status
- Finding recently created listings across all collections

## Optimizing GraphQL Queries

Beyond schema design, how you write your GraphQL queries affects performance:

### Fetch Only What You Need

Request only the fields you actually need:



### Use Pagination for Large Result Sets

Always paginate large result sets:



### Use Timestamps for Efficient Polling

When building applications that poll for updates, use timestamps to fetch only new data:



## Summary

Proper database indexing is essential for maintaining performance as your indexed data grows. By strategically placing indices on frequently queried fields and field combinations, you can ensure fast query responses even with large datasets.

**Key takeaways:**

- Use `@index` for frequently filtered or sorted individual fields
- Use composite indices for multi-field query patterns
- Consider performance tradeoffs for write-heavy applications
- Design your schema and queries with performance in mind from the start
- Always use pagination for large result sets

## Benchmarking Your Indexer Performance

**File:** `Advanced/performance/benchmarking.md`

## Why Benchmark Your Indexer?

Benchmarking is a critical tool for understanding and optimizing your indexer's performance. By collecting and analyzing performance metrics, you can:

- Identify bottlenecks in your indexing pipeline
- Determine if performance issues are due to data fetching, processing, or database operations
- Measure the impact of code optimizations
- Set realistic expectations for indexing speed
- Plan infrastructure requirements for production deployments

## Running Benchmarks

### Capturing Benchmark Data

To collect performance metrics while your indexer is running:



> **Note:** Benchmarking adds some memory and processing overhead. It should not be enabled in production environments, as it holds benchmark data points in memory and periodically writes them to disk.

### Viewing Benchmark Results

After running your indexer with benchmarking enabled, you can generate a performance summary:



This command processes the collected benchmark data and displays a comprehensive performance report.

## Understanding Benchmark Output

The benchmark output is divided into several sections, each providing insights into different aspects of your indexer's performance:

### Time Breakdown



**What This Tells You:**

- **Total Runtime**: Overall time the indexer has been running
- **Total Time Fetching**: Time spent retrieving data from the blockchain
- **Total Time Processing**: Time spent in event handlers and database operations

**How to Interpret:**

- If fetching time dominates (as in this example), your bottleneck is data retrieval, not processing
- If processing time is high relative to fetching, your handlers may need optimization
- Note that fetching and processing can overlap, so the sum may exceed total runtime

### General Performance Metrics



**What This Tells You:**

- **Batch Sizes Sum**: Total number of events processed
- **Total Runtime**: Precise runtime in seconds
- **Events Per Second**: Overall processing throughput

**How to Interpret:**

- Events per second is your key performance indicator
- Over 10,000 events/second represents excellent performance
- 1,000-5,000 events/second indicates good performance
- Under 500 events/second may indicate optimization opportunities

### Block Fetching Performance



**What This Tells You:**

- **Total Time Elapsed**: Time spent fetching and parsing each batch of blocks
- **Parsing Time**: Time spent decoding and preparing event data
- **Page Fetch Time**: Time spent retrieving data from the blockchain
- **Num Events**: Number of events in each batch
- **Block Range Size**: Number of blocks in each fetch operation

**How to Interpret:**

- Compare Page Fetch Time to Total Time to see if data retrieval is your bottleneck
- Large standard deviations (std-dev) indicate inconsistent performance
- If Block Range Size varies significantly, your indexer may be adjusting batch sizes dynamically

### Event Processing Performance



**What This Tells You:**

- **Batch Size**: Number of events in each processing batch
- **Contract Register Duration**: Time spent preparing contract data
- **Load Duration**: Time spent loading entities from the database
- **Handler Duration**: Time spent executing your event handler logic
- **DB Write Duration**: Time spent writing updated entities to the database
- **Total Time Elapsed**: Overall time for the processing phase

**How to Interpret:**

- Compare Load, Handler, and DB Write durations to identify bottlenecks
- In this example, DB Write (135ms) and Load (80ms) operations dominate processing time
- If Load Duration is high, consider implementing entity loaders
- If DB Write Duration is high, check if you're updating too many entities per event

### Per-Handler Performance



**What This Tells You:**

- Detailed timing for each specific event handler
- Shows average and total execution time across all events

**How to Interpret:**

- Compare different handlers to identify which ones are most expensive
- Look for handlers with high maximum values (max column), which may indicate inconsistent performance
- Handlers averaging above 1ms per event may benefit from optimization

## Interpreting Results and Taking Action

### Identifying Your Bottleneck

Based on the benchmark data, determine your primary performance bottleneck:

1. **Data Fetching Bottleneck**

   - **Symptoms**: Most time spent in "Total Time Fetching"
   - **Solutions**:
     - Use HyperSync if available for your network
     - If using RPC, consider a more performant provider
     - Adjust block batch sizes in your configuration

2. **Data Loading Bottleneck**

   - **Symptoms**: High "Load Duration" in Event Processing
   - **Solutions**:
     - Implement entity loaders to batch database operations
     - Add appropriate database indices for frequently queried fields
     - Optimize your entity relationships to reduce join complexity

3. **Handler Logic Bottleneck**

   - **Symptoms**: High "Handler Duration" relative to other metrics
   - **Solutions**:
     - Simplify complex calculations in your handlers
     - Move complex operations to a post-processing step
     - Consider caching frequently accessed values

4. **Database Write Bottleneck**
   - **Symptoms**: High "DB Write Duration"
   - **Solutions**:
     - Reduce the number of entities updated per event
     - Batch related updates where possible
     - Check if you're updating the same entity multiple times unnecessarily

### Benchmarking Best Practices

1. **Benchmark Before and After Optimizations**

   - Run benchmarks before making changes to establish a baseline
   - Run again after each optimization to measure impact

2. **Focus on the Largest Bottleneck First**

   - Prioritize optimizations based on where time is being spent
   - Small improvements to the critical path yield the greatest results

3. **Watch for Memory Usage**

   - Monitor memory consumption alongside performance metrics
   - High memory usage can lead to degraded performance over time

4. **Consider Real-World Conditions**
   - Test with realistic data volumes and event patterns
   - Include periods of high activity in your benchmark tests

## Advanced Performance Tuning

For cases where standard optimizations aren't sufficient:

1. **Custom Database Indices**

   - Create indices tailored to your specific query patterns
   - Add composite indices for multi-field filters

2. **Handler Specialization**

   - Create specialized handlers for high-volume events
   - Simplify logic for the most common paths

3. **Speak to the Envio Team**
   - We can help!

By regularly benchmarking your indexer and methodically addressing performance bottlenecks, you can achieve significant improvements in indexing speed and efficiency.

## Logging

**File:** `Troubleshoot/logging.mdx`



# Logging in Envio HyperIndex

Effective logging is essential for monitoring your indexer's performance, diagnosing issues, and gathering insights. The Envio indexer uses pino, a high-performance logging library for JavaScript. These logs can be integrated with analytics tools such as Kibana to generate metrics and visualizations.

## Table of Contents

- User Logging - How to implement logging in your event handlers
- Configuration & Output Formats - Configuring log output and formats
- Log Levels - Understanding available log levels
- Troubleshooting - Common issues and solutions

## Users

When implementing handlers for your indexer, use the logging functions provided in the context object. These functions allow you to record events and errors at different severity levels.

### Available Logging Methods

- `.log.debug` - For detailed debugging information
- `.log.info` - For general information about application flow
- `.log.warn` - For potentially problematic situations
- `.log.error` - For error events that might still allow the application to continue

### Examples by Language


  



  


## Metrics, Debugging, and Troubleshooting

The Envio indexer provides flexible logging configurations to suit different environments and use cases.

### Output Formats

The default output format is human-readable with color-coded log levels (`console-pretty`). You can modify the output format using environment variables:



For production environments or detailed analytics, consider integrating logs with Kibana or similar tools. We're developing Kibana dashboards for self-hosting and UI dashboards for our hosting solution. If you have specific dashboard requirements, please contact us on Discord.

## Developer Logging

### Log Levels

The indexer supports the following log levels in ascending order of severity:



> **Note**: Log levels prefixed with `u` (like `udebug`) are user-level logs emitted from the context for handlers or loaders.

### Configuring Log Levels

Set log levels using these environment variables:



Example:



### Troubleshooting

When debugging issues in development:

1. **Terminal UI Issues**: The Terminal UI may sometimes hide errors. To disable it:

   

2. **Log Visibility**: To maintain the Terminal UI while capturing detailed logs:
   

This approach allows you to view essential information in the UI while capturing comprehensive logs for troubleshooting.

**File:** `Troubleshoot/common-issues.md`

This guide helps you identify and resolve common issues you might encounter when working with Envio HyperIndex. If you don't find a solution to your problem here, please join our Discord community for additional support.

## Table of Contents

- Setup and Configuration Issues
  - Module Not Found Errors
  - Smart Contract Updates
  - Node.js Version Compatibility
  - PNPM Version Compatibility
- Runtime Issues
  - Indexer Start Block Issues
  - Tables Not Registered in Hasura
  - RPC-Related Issues
- Infrastructure Conflicts
  - Local Postgres Conflicts

## Setup and Configuration Issues

### Cannot find module errors on `pnpm start`

**Problem:** Errors like `Cannot find module` when starting your indexer indicate missing generated files.

**Cause:** The indexer cannot find necessary files, typically because the code generation step was skipped after cloning the repository.

**Solution:**

1. Delete the `generated` folder if it exists
2. Run the code generation command:



> **Important:** Always run `pnpm codegen` immediately after cloning an indexer repository using Envio.

### Smart contract updated after the initial codegen

**Problem:** Changes to smart contracts aren't reflected in your indexer.

**Cause:** When smart contracts are modified after initial setup, the ABIs need to be regenerated and the indexer needs to be updated.

**Solution:**

1. Re-export smart contract ABIs (example using Hardhat):



2. Verify that the ABI directory in `config.yaml` points to the correct location where ABIs were freshly generated
3. Run codegen again:



### Using the correct version of Node.js

**Problem:** Compatibility issues or unexpected errors when running the indexer.

**Solution:** Envio requires Node.js v18 or newer. If you're using Node.js v16 or older, please update:



### Using the correct version of PNPM

**Problem:** Package management issues or build failures.

**Solution:** Envio requires pnpm v8 or newer. If you're using v7.8 or older, please update:



## Runtime Issues

### Indexer not starting at the specified start block

**Problem:** The indexer runs but doesn't start from the `start_block` defined in your configuration.

**Cause:** This typically happens when the indexer's state is persisted from a previous run.

**Solution:** Stop the indexer completely before restarting:



### Tables for entities are not registered on Hasura

**Problem:** Entity tables defined in your schema don't appear in Hasura.

**Cause:** Database schema might be out of sync with your entity definitions.

**Solution:** Reset the indexer environment to recreate the necessary tables:



### RPC-Related issues

**Problem:** The indexer shows warnings such as:

- `Error getting events, will retry after backoff time`
- `Failed Combined Query Filter from block`
- `Issue while running fetching batch of events from the RPC. Will wait ()ms and try again.`

**Cause:** Issues connecting to or retrieving data from the blockchain RPC endpoint.

**Solutions:**

1. **Recommended:** Use HyperSync if your network is supported, as it provides better performance and reliability

2. If HyperSync isn't an option, try:
   - Using a different RPC endpoint in your `config.yaml`
   - Verifying your RPC endpoint is stable and has archive data if needed
   - Checking if your RPC provider has rate limits you're exceeding



## Infrastructure Conflicts

### Postgres running locally

**Problem:** Conflicts when Postgres is already running on port 5432.

**Cause:** The default Postgres port (5432) is already in use by another instance.

**Solution:** Configure Envio to use a different port by setting environment variables:



You can further customize your Postgres connection with these additional environment variables:

- `ENVIO_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Set a custom password
- `ENVIO_PG_USER`: Set a custom username
- `ENVIO_PG_DATABASE`: Set a custom database name

## Reserved Words in Envio

**File:** `Troubleshoot/reserved-words.md`

## Overview

When creating your Envio indexer, certain words cannot be used in entity names, field names, contract names, or event names because they are reserved by the underlying programming languages or by Envio itself. Using these reserved words will trigger validation errors (such as `EE102` for configuration files or `EE210` for schema files).

Reserved words in Envio are taken from JavaScript, TypeScript, and ReScript because Envio generates code in these languages to power your indexer. Using these reserved words would create syntax conflicts in the generated code.

## Why This Matters

When you define names in your:

- `config.yaml` file (for contracts and events)
- `schema.graphql` file (for entities and fields)

Envio automatically generates code based on these names. If you use reserved words, the generated code will contain syntax errors and will not compile, causing your indexer to fail.

## Common Error Scenarios

If you use reserved words, you'll encounter these errors:

- **Error `EE102`**: Reserved words in the configuration file
- **Error `EE210`**: Reserved words in the schema file
- **Error `EE212`**: Reserved enum names that conflict with Envio internal types

## How to Fix Reserved Word Errors

When you encounter these errors, you need to rename the offending identifiers:

1. Identify which names in your configuration or schema are using reserved words
2. Choose alternative names that aren't reserved
3. Update all references to these names in your code
4. Run codegen again to regenerate the code

### Example Problem





### Example Solution





## Tips for Avoiding Reserved Word Conflicts

- Use camelCase or PascalCase for naming (e.g., `userAccount` instead of `class`)
- Add a prefix or suffix to potentially conflicting names (e.g., `userInterface` instead of `interface`)
- Use domain-specific terms that are less likely to be programming keywords
- When in doubt, check against the lists below before finalizing your schema or configuration

## Complete List of Reserved Words

### JavaScript Reserved Words

These keywords cannot be used as identifiers in your Envio configuration or schema:



### TypeScript Reserved Words

In addition to JavaScript keywords, these TypeScript-specific keywords are also reserved:



### ReScript Reserved Words

These ReScript-specific keywords are also reserved:



### Envio Internal Reserved Types

These types are used internally by Envio and cannot be used as enum or entity names:



## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive names** that are unlikely to be programming keywords
2. **Check these lists** before finalizing your schema design
3. **Run validation early** with `pnpm codegen` to catch issues before spending time on implementation
4. **Use prefixes for domain entities** (e.g., `TokenTransfer` instead of `Transfer`)

If you encounter persistent issues with reserved words or need help refactoring your schema to avoid them, please reach out for support on our Discord community.

## Indexing on Fuel Network

**File:** `fuel/fuel.md`

## Introduction

Envio has expanded its indexing capabilities beyond EVM-compatible blockchains to now fully support the Fuel Network (both mainnet and testnet). This documentation covers how to use Envio's products with Fuel's unique architecture and features. ⛽⚡

Fuel offers several advantages as a modular execution layer including:

- Parallel transaction execution
- State-minimized design
- UTXO-based architecture
- Advanced FuelVM capabilities

## HyperIndex for Fuel

HyperIndex enables developers to easily index and query real-time and historical data on Fuel Network with the same powerful features available for EVM chains.

### Getting Started with Fuel Indexing

You can start indexing Fuel contracts in two ways:

1. **Quick Start (5-minute tutorial)**: Follow our step-by-step tutorial to create your first Fuel indexer quickly.

2. **No-Code Contract Import**: Use our Contract Import tool to automatically generate configuration and schema files for your Fuel contracts.

### Example Fuel Indexers

Looking for inspiration? Check out these indexers built by projects in the Fuel ecosystem:

| Project                               | Type             | GitHub Repository                                                                 |

| Greeter                               | Tutorial         | github                                |

### Features Supported on Fuel

HyperIndex for Fuel supports all the core features available in the EVM version:

- ✅ No-code Contract Import
- ✅ Dynamic Contracts / Factory Tracking
- ✅ Testing Framework
- ✅ Hosted Service
- ✅ Wildcard Indexing

## Fuel-Specific Event Types

### Understanding Fuel's Event Model

Fuel's event model differs significantly from EVM. Instead of predefined events, Fuel uses a more flexible approach with various receipt types that can be indexed.

### LOG_DATA Receipts (Primary Event Type)

The most common event type in Fuel is the `LOG_DATA` receipt, created by the `log` instruction in Sway contracts.

Unlike Solidity's `emit` which requires predefined event structures, Sway's `log` function allows passing any data, providing greater flexibility.

#### Configuration Example:



The `logId` is a unique identifier for the logged struct, which you can find in your contract's ABI file.

#### Auto-detection of logId:

If your event name matches the logged struct name in Sway, you can omit the `logId`:



> **Tip**: Instead of manually configuring events, use the Contract Import tool which automatically detects events and generates the proper configuration.

### Additional Fuel Event Types

Fuel allows indexing several additional receipt types not available in EVM:

| Event Type | Description                                      | Example Configuration |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| `Mint`     | Triggered when a contract mints tokens           | `- name: Mint`        |
| `Burn`     | Triggered when a contract burns tokens           | `- name: Burn`        |
| `Transfer` | Combines `TRANSFER` and `TRANSFER_OUT` receipts  | `- name: Transfer`    |
| `Call`     | Triggered when a contract calls another contract | `- name: Call`        |

#### Using Custom Names:

You can rename these events while maintaining their type:



> **Note**: All event types can be used with Wildcard Indexing.

### Transfer Event Specifics

The `Transfer` event type combines two Fuel receipt types:

- `TRANSFER`: Emitted when a contract transfers tokens to another contract
- `TRANSFER_OUT`: Emitted when a contract transfers tokens to a wallet

> **Important**: Transfers between wallets are not included in the `Transfer` event type.

## Event Object Structure in Handlers

When handling Fuel events, the event object structure differs from EVM:



## Migration Guide from v2.x.x-fuel

Starting with V2.3, the Fuel indexer has been integrated into the main `envio` package. If you were using the Fuel-specific version (`envio@2.x.x-fuel`), follow these steps to migrate:

### 1. Update Package Version



### 2. Update Configuration

Add the `ecosystem: fuel` field to your `config.yaml`:



### 3. Update Event Handler Code

Several field names have changed in the event object:

| Old Field             | New Field              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `event.data.x`        | `event.params.x`       |
| `event.time`          | `event.block.time`     |
| `event.blockHeight`   | `event.block.height`   |
| (none)                | `event.block.id`       |
| `event.transactionId` | `event.transaction.id` |
| `event.contractId`    | `event.srcAddress`     |
| `event.receiptIndex`  | `event.logIndex`       |
| `event.receiptType`   | (removed)              |

Example migration:



> **Note**: If you use loaders, also follow the v1 to v2 migration guide for loader-specific changes.

## Licensing

**File:** `licensing.md`

## TL;DR

- Envio's licensing reflects open source ethos but is not OSI recognized.
- Developers can use Envio's services without vendor lock-in, either by self-hosting or specifying an RPC URL.
- The generated code is open and public
- Our license allows self-hosting but restricts third-party competition with Envio's hosted service.
- Envio may consider open-sourcing in the future but prioritizes stakeholder interests and market traction.

## Our position

We're devs and we value OS ethos too, that's why our licensing mirrors a lot of the benefits from open source licensing however Envio and its products do not use a recognized open source license by the OSI, we are however public and open and our licensing reflects this.

Our future business model lies in our hosted service and HyperSync requests and so we are protecting this, but to ensure continuity and no vendor lock-in, developers are able to run and develop on their indexer without either. Either by self-hosting, which our license permits, or by specifying an RPC URL in their indexer configuration and thus bypassing HyperSync.

Envio is in its formative stages and though we may look to open-source the software in the future we are dedicated to ensuring the best interests of all stakeholders. Going open source is somewhat of a one-way function and it is easier to go open source than to proverbially go "closed source". Once we have gained more market traction we will review our position on going open source.

## Index

**File:** `supported-networks/index.md`

HyperIndex natively supports indexing any EVM blockchain out of the box. As a developer you can start indexing and querying your smart contract data across any EVM-compatible L1, L2, or L3 blockchain using HyperIndex.

HyperIndex also supports data indexing on Fuel.

:::info
The backbone of HyperIndex’s blazing-fast indexing speed lies in using HyperSync as a more performant and cost-effective data source to RPC for data retrieval. While RPCs are functional, and can be used in HyperIndex as a data source, they are far from efficient when it comes to querying large amounts of data (a time-consuming and resource-intensive endeavour).

HyperSync is significantly faster and more cost-effective than traditional RPC methods, allowing the retrieval of multiple blocks at once, and enabling sync speeds up to 1000x faster than RPC.
:::

If a network is supported on HyperSync, then HyperSync is used by default as the data source. This means developers don't additionally need to worry about RPCs, rate-limiting, etc. This is especially valuable for multi-chain apps.

If the network that you want to index is not supported on HyperSync, please navigate to RPC Data Source for more information to use RPC as a data source.

You can also request a network to be added to HyperSync in the Discord.

### Overview

Envio is a modular hyper-performant data indexing solution for Base, enabling applications and developers to efficiently index and aggregate real-time and historical blockchain data. Envio offers three primary solutions for indexing and accessing large amounts of data: HyperIndex (a customizable indexing framework), HyperSync (a real-time indexed data layer), and HyperRPC (extremely fast read-only RPC).

HyperSync accelerates the synchronization of historical data on Base, enabling what usually takes hours to sync millions of events to be completed in under a minute—up to 1000x faster than traditional RPC methods.

Designed to optimize the user experience, Envio offers automatic code generation, flexible language support, multi-chain data aggregation, and a reliable, cost-effective hosted service.

To get started, see our documentation or follow our quickstart guide.
