# Hosted Service Features

Our hosted service includes several production-ready features to help you manage and secure your indexer deployments.

:::info Plan Availability
Most features listed on this page are available for **paid production plans only**. The free development tier has limited features and is designed for testing and development purposes. [View our pricing tiers](./hosted-service-billing.mdx) to see what's included in each plan.
:::

## IP/Domain Whitelisting

Control access to your indexer by restricting requests to specific IP addresses or domains. This security feature helps protect your data and ensures only authorized clients can query your indexer.

**Benefits:**
- Enhanced security for sensitive data
- Prevent unauthorized access
- Control API usage from specific sources
- Ideal for production environments with strict access requirements

**Technical Implementation:**
- **IP Whitelisting**: Full IP address validation and blocking
- **Domain Whitelisting**: Best-effort domain validation using SNI (Server Name Indication) checking
- Domain filtering does not involve mutual TLS (mTLS) or client certificate validation

:::info Domain Whitelisting Limitations
Domain whitelisting relies on SNI checking and may not provide the same level of security as IP whitelisting. For maximum security, consider using IP whitelisting when possible.

## Built-in Alerts

Stay informed about your indexer's health and performance with our integrated alerting system. Configure multiple notification channels and choose which alerts you want to receive.

:::info Version Requirement
This feature is only available for indexers deployed with version 2.24.0 or higher.

## Zero-Downtime Deployments

Update your indexer without any service interruption using our seamless deployment system with static production endpoints.

**How it works:**
- Deploy new versions alongside your current deployment
- Each indexer gets a **static production endpoint** that remains consistent
- Use 'Promote to Production' to instantly route the static endpoint to any deployment
- All requests to your static production endpoint are automatically routed to the promoted deployment
- Maintain API availability throughout upgrades with no endpoint changes required

**Key Features:**
- **Static Production Endpoint**: Consistent URL that never changes, regardless of which deployment is active
- **Instant Switching**: Promote any deployment to production with zero downtime
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Quickly switch back to previous deployments if needed
- **Seamless Updates**: Your applications continue working without any configuration changes
