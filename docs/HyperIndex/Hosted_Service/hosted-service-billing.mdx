# Pricing & Billing

Envio offers flexible pricing options to meet the needs of projects at different stages of development.

## Pricing Structure

We have both development tiers and production tiers to suit a variety of users:

- **Development Tier**: Our development tier is completely free and designed to be user-friendly, making it easy to get started with Envio without any cost barriers.

- **Production Tiers**: For projects ready for production, we offer scalable options that grow with your needs.

## Self-Hosting Option

For users who prefer to manage their own infrastructure, we support self-hosting your indexer as well. For your convenience, there is a Docker file in the root of the `generated` folder.

For more information on self-hosting, see our [Self-Hosting Guide](/docs/HyperIndex/self-hosting).
