There are different types of performance that you may be concerned about when indexing using HyperIndex. There is the speed of historical sync (populating the db from scratch), the latency of indexing new blocks/transactions, and the speed of querying the data once it is indexed. This page will cover some of the ways you can optimize the performance of your HyperIndex setup.
