The backbone of HyperIndexâ€™s blazing-fast indexing speed lies in using HyperSync as a more performant and cost-effective data source to RPC for data retrieval. While RPCs are functional, and can be used in HyperIndex as a data source, they are far from efficient when it comes to querying large amounts of data (a time-consuming and resource-intensive endeavour).

HyperSync is used by default as the data source for indexing. This means developers don't additionally need to worry about RPCs, rate-limiting, etc. With HyperSync, what would usually take hours or days to sync millions of events can now be done in minutes! 

Since this service is a layer above the blockchain we maintain and host this service for each supported network. Visit the HyperSync docs to learn more about [HyperSync](/docs/HyperSync/overview) and its [supported networks](/docs/HyperSync/hypersync-supported-networks). 


In the example below, the absence of `rpc_config` will automatically direct Envio to HyperSync for the defined network (Polygon).

```yaml
name: Greeter
description: Greeter indexer
networks:
  - id: 137 # Polygon
    start_block: 0
    contracts:
      - name: PolygonGreeter
        abi_file_path: abis/greeter-abi.json
        address: 0x9D02A17dE4E68545d3a58D3a20BbBE0399E05c9c
        handler: ./src/EventHandlers.bs.js
        events:
          - event: NewGreeting
          - event: ClearGreeting
```

For HyperSync users can use `start_block` of 0 regardless of when the deployments for the contracts to be indexed were, as HyperSync can very quickly detect the first block where it needs to start indexing from automatically.
