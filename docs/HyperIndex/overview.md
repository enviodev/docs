:::info HyperIndex & HyperSync

**HyperIndex** is Envio's full-featured blockchain indexing framework that transforms on-chain events into structured, queryable databases with GraphQL APIs.

**HyperSync** is the high-performance data engine that powers HyperIndex. It provides the raw blockchain data access layer, delivering up to 2000x faster performance than traditional RPC endpoints.

While HyperIndex gives you a complete indexing solution with schema management and event handling, HyperSync can be used directly for custom data pipelines and specialized applications.
