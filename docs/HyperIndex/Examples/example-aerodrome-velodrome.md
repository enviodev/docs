# Velodrome & Aerodrome DEX Indexer

This indexer provides a comprehensive implementation for tracking data from the popular Velodrome and Aerodrome decentralized exchanges across multiple chains.

## Overview

The [Velodrome & Aerodrome Indexer](https://github.com/enviodev/velodrome-indexer) demonstrates how to:

- Create a **multi-chain indexer** that works across Superchain networks
- Index core DEX functionality including pools, swaps, and liquidity positions
- Unify data access through a single GraphQL API
- Build efficient handlers using TypeScript

## Key Features

- Complete tracking of liquidity pools and trading activity
- Real-time synchronization across multiple networks
- Well-documented codebase suitable as a starting point for similar DEX indexers
- Making ad-hoc RPC requests for additional data (use with caution)

For implementation details, usage examples, and setup instructions, see the project's [README](https://github.com/enviodev/velodrome-indexer/blob/main/README.md).

:::note
This indexer was built by Envio partners and community builders. While it provides a valuable reference implementation, it may not be using the latest version of Envio's tooling. Always perform appropriate testing and data validation before using in production environments.
