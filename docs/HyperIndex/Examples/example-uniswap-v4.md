# Uniswap V4 Multi-chain Indexer

The following indexer example is a reference implementation and can serve as a starting point for applications with similar logic.

This [official Uniswap V4 indexer](https://github.com/enviodev/uniswap-v4-indexer) is a comprehensive implementation for the Uniswap V4 protocol using Envio HyperIndex. This is the same indexer that powers the [v4.xyz](https://v4.xyz) website, providing real-time data for the Uniswap V4 interface.

## Key Features

- **Multi-chain Support**: Indexes Uniswap V4 deployments across 10 different blockchain networks in real-time
- **Complete Pool Metrics**: Tracks pool statistics including volume, TVL, fees, and other critical metrics
- **Swap Analysis**: Monitors swap events and liquidity changes with high precision
- **Hook Integration**: In-progress support for Uniswap V4 hooks and their events
- **Production Ready**: Powers the official v4.xyz interface with production-grade reliability
- **Ultra-Fast Syncing**: Processes massive amounts of blockchain data significantly faster than alternative indexing solutions, reducing sync times from days to minutes
