The following indexer example is a reference implementation and can serve as a starting point for applications with similar logic.

This [repo](https://github.com/sablier-labs/subgraphs/tree/main/apps/lockup-envio) contains a comprehensive example indexer for the Sablier protocol using Envio HyperIndex.  

This indexer is a multi-chain indexer, built using TypeScript, that indexes data across 18 EVM chains. Data is accessible via a unified graphQL API.

More information see the [Sablier documentation](https://docs.sablier.com/api/indexers/endpoints). 

:::note
It is important to note that these are not vetted for accuracy, and testing or some level of data validation is always recommended. Additionally the indexer my not be using the latest version and was built by Envio partners and community builders.
