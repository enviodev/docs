# Cross-Chain Messaging Indexer

This blockchain indexer demonstrates how to track and index cross-chain messaging protocols at scale, providing a complete view of message passing across multiple blockchains.

## Overview

The [ORMP Indexer](https://github.com/ringecosystem/ormpexer/tree/main) showcases advanced multichain indexing techniques for tracking cross-chain communication. It offers a practical example of how to:

- Monitor message passing across 14 different EVM-compatible blockchains
- Combine both HyperSync and RPC data sources for optimal performance
- Create a unified data model for cross-chain events
- Build a scalable indexing solution for complex cross-chain applications

## Key Features

- Comprehensive tracking of cross-chain message delivery and execution
- Efficient data collection using a hybrid approach (HyperSync + RPC)
- Well-structured GraphQL API for querying cross-chain messaging data
- Example implementation that can be adapted for other cross-chain protocols

## Use Cases

This blockchain indexer can serve as a foundation for applications requiring visibility into cross-chain operations, including:

- Cross-chain bridges and token transfer monitoring
- Multichain DeFi dashboards
- Cross-chain governance systems
- Message delivery verification tools

:::note
This blockchain indexer was built by Envio partners and community builders. While it provides a valuable reference implementation, it may not be using the latest version of Envio's tooling. Always perform appropriate testing and data validation before using in production environments.
