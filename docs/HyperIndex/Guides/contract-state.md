# Contract State

TLDR; The repo for the code base can be found [here](https://github.com/enviodev/rpc-token-data-example)

**Scenario**  
In this guide, we aim to get token information for every token involved in a [Uniswap V3 pool creation event](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/core/interfaces/IUniswapV3Factory#poolcreated). For each token we should index its name, symbol and decimals.

**Problem**  
At first glance this may appear to be a simple task as we are only indexing over one event, the [pool created](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/core/interfaces/IUniswapV3Factory#poolcreated) event. However, there is one catch, have a look at the event signature: 

```yaml
PoolCreated(address indexed token0, address indexed token1, uint24 indexed fee, int24 tickSpacing, address pool)
```

The event only provides the token addresses, not the token name, symbol, and decimals. So how are we to fetch this extra information in our event handler? 

**Solution**  
In order to do this, we need to make RPC requests to the token contract.

### Prerequisites

This guide assumes basic familiarity with the viem library for making contract calls. Check out the [viem documentation](https://viem.sh/) for more information. This [medium article](https://medium.com/@0xape/typescript-and-viem-quickstart-for-blockchain-scripting-3f1846970b6f) is highly recommended for a gentle introduction to viem with a very similar example to what we are doing here.

### Part 1: Create our Uniswap V3 `poolcreated` indexer

`npx envio init`
Ethereum mainnet contract address: [0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984](https://scope.sh/1/address/0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984)

We then make some light modifications to remove unnecessary events and simplify the schema. The resulting config, schema, and event handlers look as follows:

> config.yaml

:::info
We remove the `FeeAmountEnabled` and `OwnerChanged` events as they are not relevant to our use case. Also we set the start-block to 21000000 as rpc calls are very slow. See the [rpc rate limiting](#challenges) section for possible solutions.
:::

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=./node_modules/envio/evm.schema.json
name: uniswap-v3-factory-token-indexer
networks:
- id: 1
  start_block: 21000000
  contracts:
  - name: UniswapV3Factory
    address:
    - 0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984
    handler: src/EventHandlers.ts
    events:
    - event: FeeAmountEnabled(uint24 indexed fee, int24 indexed tickSpacing)
    - event: OwnerChanged(address indexed oldOwner, address indexed newOwner)
    - event: PoolCreated(address indexed token0, address indexed token1, uint24 indexed fee, int24 tickSpacing, address pool)
rollback_on_reorg: false

```

> shema.graphql

:::info
Simplify our schema to only include the pool and token information.
:::

```graphql
type Token {
  id: ID! #address
  name: String!
  symbol: String!
  decimals: Int!
}

type Pool {
  id: ID! # address
  token0: Token! 
  token1: Token!
  fee: BigInt!
  tickSpacing: BigInt!
  pool: String!
}
```

> src/EventHandlers.ts

```typescript
import {
  UniswapV3Factory,
  Pool,
} from "generated";
import { getTokenDetails } from "./tokenDetails";

UniswapV3Factory.PoolCreated.handler(async ({ event, context }) => {
  const entity: Pool = {
    id: `${event.chainId}_${event.block.number}_${event.logIndex}`,
    token0_id: event.params.token0,
    token1_id: event.params.token1,
    fee: event.params.fee,
    tickSpacing: event.params.tickSpacing,
    pool: event.params.pool,
  };
  context.Pool.set(entity)


  try {
    const {name: name0, symbol: symbol0, decimals: decimals0} = await getTokenDetails(event.params.token0, event.chainId, event.params.pool);
    context.Token.set({
      id: event.params.token0,
      name: name0,
      symbol: symbol0,
      decimals: decimals0
    })
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('failed token0 with address', event.params.token0)
    return
  }

  try {
    const {name: name1, symbol: symbol1, decimals: decimals1} = await getTokenDetails(event.params.token1, event.chainId, event.params.pool);
    context.Token.set({
      id: event.params.token1,
      name: name1,
      symbol: symbol1,
      decimals: decimals1,
    })
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('failed token1 with address', event.params.token1)
    return
  }
});
```

### Part 2: Fetch token information

Note how we use the `multicall` feature from Viem to batch our 3 queries into one request to improve performance and help avoid rate limiting. Very useful!


We recommend using an RPC from [dRPC](https://drpc.org/) and adding it to your `.env` file. Alternatively, use any other rpc provider of your choice.

There are 2 edge cases that we need to be aware of when fetching token information: 

1. Sometimes `symbol` and `name` are stored as bytes32 in the contract instead of strings. In this case, we need to use a different abi and convert the hex string to a readable string.
2. Some pools are created with non-standard ERC20 tokens that do not follow the ERC20 standard. In fact, some people create pools with contracts that are not even ERC20 tokens at all, even though such a pool is totally useless.

So take note of our try-catch blocks in the code below that handle these edge cases.

> src/tokenDetails.ts

:::info
The `hexToString` method from Viem adds byte padding to the string. We remove this padding by using the `replace` method. If you don't do this, there will be errors writing to the envio database.
:::

```typescript
import { createPublicClient, http, hexToString } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'
import { Cache, CacheCategory } from "./cache";
import { getERC20BytesContract, getERC20Contract } from './utils';

const RPC_URL = process.env.RPC_URL;

const client = createPublicClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http(RPC_URL),
  batch: { multicall: true }
})

export async function getTokenDetails(
  contractAddress: string,
  chainId: number,
  pool: string,
): Promise<{
  readonly name: string,
  readonly symbol: string,
  readonly decimals: number,
}> {
  const cache = await Cache.init(CacheCategory.Token, chainId);
  const token = await cache.read(contractAddress.toLowerCase());

  if (token) {
    return token;
  }

  const erc20 = getERC20Contract(contractAddress as `0x${string}`);
  const erc20Bytes = getERC20BytesContract(contractAddress as `0x${string}`);

  let results: [number, string, string];
  try {
    results = await client.multicall({
      allowFailure: false,
      contracts: [
        {
          ...erc20,
          functionName: "decimals",
        },
        {
          ...erc20,
          functionName: "name",
        },
        {
          ...erc20,
          functionName: "symbol",
        },
      ],
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("First multicall failed, trying alternate method");
    try {
      const alternateResults = await client.multicall({
        allowFailure: false,
        contracts: [
          {
            ...erc20Bytes,
            functionName: "decimals",
          },
          {
            ...erc20Bytes,
            functionName: "name",
          },
          {
            ...erc20Bytes,
            functionName: "symbol",
          },
        ],
      });
      results = [
        alternateResults[0],
        hexToString(alternateResults[1]).replace(/\u0000/g, ''),
        hexToString(alternateResults[2]).replace(/\u0000/g, ''),
      ];
    } catch (alternateError) {
      console.error(`Alternate method failed for pool ${pool}:`);
      results = [0,"unknown","unknown"];
    }
  }

  const [decimals, name, symbol] = results;
  
  console.log(`Got token details for ${contractAddress}: ${name} (${symbol}) with ${decimals} decimals`);

  const entry = {
    name,
    symbol,
    decimals
  } as const;

  cache.add({ [contractAddress.toLowerCase()]: entry as any });
  return entry;
}
```

### Part 3: Cache token information

To highlight how important this step is in our use case, imagine how many Uniswap V3 pools have been created with USDC. It would be a complete waste of time to make an rpc request for USDC every time it was involved in a pool creation event!

Since the token details we care about don't change over time, we can cache this information to avoid making the same rpc request multiple times.  We can do this by creating a simple cache object that stores the token information. In this case, we cache the data in a json file. For use cases with more data, you should consider using a proper database as accessing a large json file repeatedly can be slow. See the [ipfs example](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/ipfs) for an example of how to cache using a SQLite database.

:::info
our cache implementation is designed to be easily extendable as you can add as many cache categories as you want. Here we only have one category for token information.
:::

> src/cache.ts

```typescript
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as path from "path";

export const CacheCategory = {
  Token: "token",
} as const;

export type CacheCategory = (typeof CacheCategory)[keyof typeof CacheCategory];

type Address = string;

type Shape = Record<string, Record<string, string>>;
type ShapeRoot = Shape & Record<Address, { hash: string }>;

type ShapeToken = Shape &
  Record<Address, { decimals: number; name: string; symbol: string }>;


export class Cache {
  static init<C = CacheCategory>(
    category: C,
    chainId: number | string | bigint
  ) {
    if (!Object.values(CacheCategory).find((c) => c === category)) {
      throw new Error("Unsupported cache category");
    }

    type S = C extends "token"
      ? ShapeToken
      : ShapeRoot;
    const entry = new Entry<S>(`${category}-${chainId.toString()}`);
    return entry;
  }
}

export class Entry<T extends Shape> {
  private memory: Shape = {};

  static encoding = "utf8" as const;
  static folder = "./.cache" as const;

  public readonly key: string;
  public readonly file: string;

  constructor(key: string) {
    this.key = key;
    this.file = Entry.resolve(key);

    this.preflight();
    this.load();
  }

  public read(key: string) {
    const memory = this.memory || {};
    return memory[key] as T[typeof key];
  }

  public load() {
    try {
      const data = fs.readFileSync(this.file, Entry.encoding);
      this.memory = JSON.parse(data) as T;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      this.memory = {};
    }
  }

  public add<N extends T>(fields: N) {
    if (!this.memory || Object.values(this.memory).length === 0) {
      this.memory = fields;
    } else {
      Object.keys(fields).forEach((key) => {
        if (!this.memory[key]) {
          this.memory[key] = {};
        }
        Object.keys(fields[key]).forEach((nested) => {
          this.memory[key][nested] = fields[key][nested];
        });
      });
    }

    this.publish();
  }

  private preflight() {
    /** Ensure cache folder exists */
    if (!fs.existsSync(Entry.folder)) {
      fs.mkdirSync(Entry.folder);
    }
    if (!fs.existsSync(this.file)) {
      fs.writeFileSync(this.file, JSON.stringify({}));
    }
  }

  private publish() {
    const prepared = JSON.stringify(this.memory);
    try {
      fs.writeFileSync(this.file, prepared);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  }

  static resolve(key: string) {
    return path.join(Entry.folder, key.toLowerCase().concat(".json"));
  }
}
```

### Challenges

1. **Historical state**: The RPC requests as shown here function as a regular RPC requests that return the current contract state. They do not fetch historical contract state. In other words, normal RPC requests always return current contract state, not the contract state for the block which your indexer is processing. For our use case, this doesn't matter as the name, symbol, and decimals of a token should not change over time. But let's say you want to fetch the ether balance of an account at a specific historical block, you would a need [special rpc request](https://docs.etherscan.io/api-pro/api-pro#get-historical-ether-balance-for-a-single-address-by-blockno) that is able to fetch historical state.
2. **Rate limiting**: Rate limiting refers to when a server limits the number of requests a client can make in a given amount of time. This is done to prevent abuse of the server. So if you make too many RPC requests in a short period of time to the same server, your requests may be blocked. The simplest way to avoid this is to use a paid unthrottled rpc or to check the rate limits of the server you are making requests to and adding a sufficient delay between requests. A slightly more complex way is to use multiple RPC URLs and rotate your requests between them. In our use case, the multicall feature to batch our requests was sufficient to avoid rate limiting.
