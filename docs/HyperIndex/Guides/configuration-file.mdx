# Setting up Configuration File

The `config.yaml` outlines the specifications for the indexer, including network and contract details, as well as event information to be used in the indexing process. For a full specification, view the [explorer](#explorer) below.

## Example Configuration

Here is an example `config.yaml` from the TypeScript Greeter template:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=./node_modules/envio/evm.schema.json
name: Greeter
description: Greeter indexer
#Global contract definitions that must contain all definitions except
#addresses. Now you can share a single handler/abi/event definitions
#for contracts across multiple chains
contracts:
  - name: Greeter
    abi_file_path: ./abis/greeter-abi.json
    handler: ./src/EventHandlers.ts
    events:
      - event: NewGreeting
      - event: ClearGreeting
networks:
  - id: 137 # Polygon
    start_block: 45336336
    contracts:
      - name: Greeter #A reference to the global contract definition
        address: 0x9D02A17dE4E68545d3a58D3a20BbBE0399E05c9c
  - id: 59144 # Linea
    start_block: 367801
    contracts:
      - name: Greeter #A reference to the global contract definition
        address: 0xdEe21B97AB77a16B4b236F952e586cf8408CF32A
```

Once you have set up your config file and the [schema](./schema-file.md), you are ready to generate the indexing code required to write the event handlers.

Run the following command:

```bash
envio codegen
```

## Contract Addresses

For the `address` field in the configuration file, use the address that emits the events.

- **Transparent Proxy Pattern:** Use the address of the proxy contract, as this is the contract that emits the events. Retrieve the ABI from the implementation contract.
- **No Proxy Contract:** Use the same address from which the ABI was obtained.

If multiple contract addresses need to be indexed, they can be entered as an array like `["0xAddress1", "0xAddress2"]` or in a dash-denominated list as seen in this [example](https://github.com/enviodev/univ3ethusdc-pool-multichain/blob/main/config.yaml) repo.

You can also choose to omit the address field for use cases like a factory contract where addresses will by dynamically registered during the indexing process.

## Human-Readable ABI Format

In the configuration, you can optionally pass the file path to the ABI for a contract in the `abi_file_path` field, or you can specify the event signature in the event field. 

Here is an example from the above configuration:

```yaml
events:
  - event: "NewGreeting(address user, string greeting)"
  - event: "ClearGreeting(address user)"
```

More information on Human Readable ABI parsing is available [here](https://docs.rs/ethers-core/latest/ethers_core/abi/struct.AbiParser.html).

> **Dev note:** An error in the ABI or the event signature will result in the events not matching, and they may not reflect in the `raw_events_table` or propagate correctly into the event handler logic.

## Field Selection

Field selection allows you to add additional data points to each event that gets passed to your handlers. For an exhaustive list of fields that can be added, see the [explorer](#explorer) below.

By default, `number`, `hash`, and `timestamp` are already selected for `block_fields` and do not need to be configured.

*Note:* Regarding indexing from RPC, currently only `hash` and `transaction_index` are supported in `transaction_fields`.

### Example:

```yaml
field_selection:
  transaction_fields:
    - "hash"
    - "transactionIndex"
    - "gasUsed"
  block_fields:
    - "parentHash"
```

## Additional Guidelines

- The contract name field (`Greeter` in the example above) should contain a single word, as it is used to create a namespace for functions in the indexer.
- The address field should contain the address of the proxy contract, which emits the events on the specified blockchain.
- If the human-readable ABI format is not used, the ABI referenced in the config file needs to be copied from the implementation contract into the specified ABI directory.
