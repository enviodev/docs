# Setting up Configuration File

The `config.yaml` outlines the specifications for the indexer, including network and contract details, as well as event information to be used in the indexing process. For a full specification, view the [explorer](#explorer) below.

## Example Configuration

Here is an example `config.yaml` from the TypeScript Greeter template:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=./node_modules/envio/evm.schema.json
name: Greeter
description: Greeter indexer
#Global contract definitions that must contain all definitions except
#addresses. Now you can share a single handler/abi/event definitions
#for contracts across multiple chains
contracts:
  - name: Greeter
    abi_file_path: ./abis/greeter-abi.json
    handler: ./src/EventHandlers.ts
    events:
      - event: NewGreeting
      - event: ClearGreeting
networks:
  - id: 137 # Polygon
    start_block: 45336336
    contracts:
      - name: Greeter #A reference to the global contract definition
        address: 0x9D02A17dE4E68545d3a58D3a20BbBE0399E05c9c
  - id: 59144 # Linea
    start_block: 367801
    contracts:
      - name: Greeter #A reference to the global contract definition
        address: 0xdEe21B97AB77a16B4b236F952e586cf8408CF32A
```

Once you have set up your config file and the [schema](./schema-file.md), you are ready to generate the indexing code required to write the event handlers.

Run the following command:

```bash
envio codegen
```

## Contract Addresses

For the `address` field in the configuration file, use the address that emits the events.

- **Transparent Proxy Pattern:** Use the address of the proxy contract, as this is the contract that emits the events. Retrieve the ABI from the implementation contract.
- **No Proxy Contract:** Use the same address from which the ABI was obtained.

If multiple contract addresses need to be indexed, they can be entered as an array like `["0xAddress1", "0xAddress2"]` or in a dash-denominated list as seen in this [example](https://github.com/enviodev/univ3ethusdc-pool-multichain/blob/main/config.yaml) repo.

You can also choose to omit the address field for use cases like a factory contract where addresses will by dynamically registered during the indexing process.

## Human-Readable ABI Format

In the configuration, you can optionally pass the file path to the ABI for a contract in the `abi_file_path` field, or you can specify the event signature in the event field. 

Here is an example from the above configuration:

```yaml
events:
  - event: "NewGreeting(address user, string greeting)"
  - event: "ClearGreeting(address user)"
```

More information on Human Readable ABI parsing is available [here](https://docs.rs/ethers-core/latest/ethers_core/abi/struct.AbiParser.html).

> **Dev note:** An error in the ABI or the event signature will result in the events not matching, and they may not reflect in the `raw_events_table` or propagate correctly into the event handler logic.

## Additional Guidelines

- The contract name field (`Greeter` in the example above) should contain a single word, as it is used to create a namespace for functions in the indexer.
- The address field should contain the address of the proxy contract, which emits the events on the specified blockchain.
- If the human-readable ABI format is not used, the ABI referenced in the config file needs to be copied from the implementation contract into the specified ABI directory.
