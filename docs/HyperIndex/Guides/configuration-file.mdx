The `config.yaml` file defines your indexer's behavior, including which blockchain events to index, contract addresses, which networks to index, and various advanced indexing options. It is a crucial step in configuring your HyperIndex setup.

After any changes to your `config.yaml` and the [schema](./schema-file.md), run:

```bash
pnpm codegen
```

This command generates necessary types and code for your event handlers.

---

## Configuration Structure

Here's an example `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
# yaml-language: $schema=./node_modules/envio/evm.schema.json
name: Greeter
description: Greeter Indexer Example

contracts:
  - name: Greeter
    abi:
      - event: "NewGreeting(address user, string greeting)"
      - event: "ClearGreeting(address user)"

networks:
  - id: 1 # ethereum-mainnet
    start_block: 12345678
    contracts:
      - name: Greeter
        address: 0x9D02A17dE4E68545d3a58D3a20BbBE0399E05c9c
```

---

## Key Configuration Options

### Contract Addresses

Set the address of the smart contract you're indexing.

:::note
Addresses can be provided in **checksum** format or in **lowercase**.
Envio accepts both and normalizes them internally.
:::

**Single address:**

```yaml
address: 0xContractAddress
```

**Multiple addresses for the same contract:**

```yaml
contracts:
  - name: MyContract
    address:
      - 0xAddress1
      - 0xAddress2
```

:::tip
If using a **proxy contract**, always use the **proxy address**, not the implementation address.
:::

**Global definitions:**  
You can also avoid repeating addresses by using global contract definitions:

```yaml
contracts:
  - name: Greeter
    abi: greeter.json

networks:
  - id: ethereum-mainnet
    contracts:
      - name: Greeter
        address: 0xProxyAddressHere
```

---

### Events Selection

Define specific events to index in a human-readable format:

```yaml
events:
  - event: "NewGreeting(address user, string greeting)"
  - event: "ClearGreeting(address user)"
```

By default, all events defined in the contract are indexed, but you can selectively disable them by removing them from this list.

#### Custom Event Names

You can assign custom names to events in `config.yaml`. This is handy when
two events share the same name but have different signatures, or when you want
a more descriptive name in your Envio project.

```yaml
events:
  - event: Assigned(address indexed recipientId, uint256 amount, address token)
  - event: Assigned(address indexed recipientId, uint256 amount, address token, address sender)
    name: AssignedWithSender
```

---

### Raw Events Storage

By default, HyperIndex doesn't store raw event data in the database to optimize performance and reduce storage requirements. However, you can enable this feature for debugging purposes or if you need to access the original event data.

To enable storage of raw events, add the following to your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
raw_events: true
```

When enabled, all indexed events will be stored in the `raw_events` table in the database, which you can view through the Hasura interface. This is particularly useful for:

- Debugging event processing issues
- Verifying that events are being captured correctly
- Creating custom queries against raw blockchain data

Note that enabling this option will increase database storage requirements and may slightly impact indexing performance.

---

### Field Selection

To improve indexing performance and reduce credits usage the `block` and `transaction` fields on event contain only a subset of the fields available on the blockchain.

To access fields that are not provided by default, specify them using the `field_selection` option for your event:

```yaml
events:
  - event: "Assigned(address indexed user, uint256 amount)"
    field_selection:
      transaction_fields:
        - transactionIndex
      block_fields:
        - timestamp
```

See all possible options in the [Interactive Schema Explorer](#interactive-schema-explorer) or use IDE autocomplete for your help.

#### Global Field Selection

You can also specify fields globally for all events in the root of the config file:

```yaml
field_selection:
  transaction_fields:
    - hash
    - gasUsed
  block_fields:
    - parentHash
```

Try to use this option sparingly as it can cause redundant Data Source calls and increased credits usage.

:::note
Field Selection per Event is available from `envio@2.11.0` and above. Please, upgrade your indexer to access this feature.
:::

---

### Unordered Multichain Mode

To improve indexing performance when indexing multiple blockchains, you can enable **Unordered Multichain Mode**. This setting allows parallel processing of events from different networks without strictly maintaining cross-chain event ordering. Useful for minimizing indexing latency when indexing at the head.

Activate this by adding to your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
unordered_multichain_mode: true
```

Learn more about when and how to use this feature [here](./multichain-indexing#unordered-multichain-mode).

---

### Rollback on Reorg

HyperIndex automatically handles blockchain reorganizations by default. To disable or customize this behavior, set the `rollback_on_reorg` flag in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
rollback_on_reorg: true # default is true
```

See detailed configuration options [here](./reorgs-support).

---

### Environment Variables

Since `envio@2.9.0`, environment variable interpolation is supported for flexibility and security:

```yaml
networks:
  - id: ${CHAIN_ID:-ethereum-mainnet}
    contracts:
      - name: Greeter
        address: ${GREETER_ADDRESS}
```

Run your indexer with custom environment variables:

```bash
CHAIN_ID=optimism ENVIO_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddress pnpm dev
```

**Interpolation syntax:**

- `${VAR}` – Use the value of `VAR`
- `${VAR:-default}` – Use `VAR` if set, otherwise use `default`

---

### Schema File Path

You can customize the path to the [schema file](./schema-file.md) using the `schema` option:

```yaml
schema: ./path/to/schema.graphql
```

By default, the `schema.graphql` is expected to be in the root directory of your project.
