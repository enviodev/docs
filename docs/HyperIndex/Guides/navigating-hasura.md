## Introduction

[Hasura](https://hasura.io/) is a GraphQL engine that provides a web interface for interacting with your indexed blockchain data. When running HyperIndex locally, Hasura serves as your primary tool for:

- Querying indexed data via GraphQL
- Visualizing database tables and relationships
- Testing API endpoints before integration with your frontend
- Monitoring the indexing process

This guide explains how to navigate the Hasura dashboard to effectively work with your indexed data.

## Accessing Hasura

When running HyperIndex locally, Hasura is automatically available at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You can access this URL in any web browser to open the Hasura console.

When prompted for authentication, use the password: `testing`

## Key Dashboard Areas

The Hasura dashboard has several tabs, but we'll focus on the two most important ones for HyperIndex developers:

### API Tab

The API tab lets you execute GraphQL queries and mutations on indexed data. It serves as a GraphQL playground for testing your API calls.

#### Features

- **Explorer Panel**: The left panel shows all available entities defined in your `schema.graphql` file
- **Query Builder**: The center area is where you write and execute GraphQL queries
- **Results Panel**: The right panel displays query results in JSON format

#### Available Entities

By default, you'll see:

- All entities defined in your `schema.graphql` file
- [`dynamic_contracts`](../Advanced/dynamic-contracts.md) (for dynamically added contracts)
- `raw_events` table (Note: This table is no longer populated by default to improve performance. To enable storage of raw events, add `raw_events: true` to your `config.yaml` file as described in the [Raw Events Storage](/docs/HyperIndex/configuration-file#raw-events-storage) section)

#### Example Query

Try a simple query to test your indexer:

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  User(limit: 5) {
    id
    latestGreeting
    numberOfGreetings
  }
}
```

Click the "Play" button to execute the query and see the results.

For more advanced GraphQL query options, see Hasura's [quickstart guide](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/queries/quickstart/).

### Data Tab

The Data tab provides direct access to your database tables and relationships, allowing you to view the actual indexed data.

#### Features

- **Schema Browser**: View all tables in the database (left panel)
- **Table Data**: Examine and browse data within each table
- **Relationship Viewer**: See how different entities are connected

#### Working with Tables

1. Select any table from the "public" schema to view its contents
2. Use the "Browse Rows" tab to see all data in that table
3. Check the "Insert Row" tab to manually add data (useful for testing)
4. View the "Modify" tab to see the table structure

#### Verifying Indexed Data

To confirm your indexer is working correctly:

1. Check entity tables to ensure they contain the expected data
2. Look at the `db_write_timestamp` column values to confirm when data was last updated
3. Newer timestamps indicate fresh data; older timestamps might indicate stale data from previous runs

## Common Tasks

### Checking Indexing Status

To verify your indexer is actively processing new blocks:

1. Go to the Data tab
2. Select any entity table
3. Check the latest `db_write_timestamp` values
4. Monitor these values over time to ensure they're updating

(Note the TUI is also an easy way to monitor this)

### Troubleshooting Missing Data

If expected data isn't appearing:

1. Check if you've enabled raw events storage (`raw_events: true` in `config.yaml`) and then examine the `raw_events` table to confirm events were captured
2. Verify your event handlers are correctly processing these events
3. Examine your GraphQL queries to ensure they match your schema structure
4. Check console logs for any processing errors

### Resetting Indexed Data

When testing, you may need to reset your database:

1. Stop your indexer
2. Reset your database (refer to the development guide for commands)
3. Restart your indexer to begin processing from the configured start block

## Best Practices

- **Regular Verification**: Periodically check both the API and Data tabs to ensure your indexer is functioning correctly
- **Query Testing**: Test complex queries in the API tab before implementing them in your application
- **Schema Validation**: Use the Data tab to verify that relationships between entities are correctly established
- **Performance Monitoring**: Watch for tables that grow unusually large, which might indicate inefficient indexing
