The following files are required from the user to run HyperIndex:

- Configuration (defaults to `config.yaml`)
- GraphQL Schema (defaults to `schema.graphql`)
- Event Handlers (defaults to `src/EventHandlers.*` depending on the language chosen)

These files are auto-generated according to the template and language chosen by running the `pnpx envio init` command.
