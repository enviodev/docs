# Logging

Logging is an important part of the indexer. It is used to track the progress of the indexer and to debug any issues that may arise. The indexer uses the [pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/). Additionally, these logs can be plugged into a tool such as [kibana](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/kibana) to generate metrics and other insights.

- [Users - logging for your event handlers](#users)
- [Metrics, Debugging, and Troubleshooting - how to use logs as a power tool](#metrics-debugging-and-troubleshooting)
- [Developer Logging - how to utilize logs within the envio codebase](#developer-logging)

## Users

Users should use the functions provided in their context for logging. These are as follows:

- `<context>.log.debug`
- `<context>.log.info`
- `<context>.log.warn`
- `<context>.log.error`
- `<context>.log.errorWithExn` : same as `error`, but takes in the exception as the first argument to neatly integrate the stacktrace and error message into the log.

```javascript
// inside your handler
context.log.debug(`We are processing the event, ${event.blockHash} (debug)`);
context.log.info(`We are processing the event, ${event.blockHash} (info)`);
context.log.warn(`We are processing the event, ${event.blockHash} (warn)`);
context.log.error(`We are processing the event, ${event.blockHash} (error)`);
context.log.errorWithExn(
  new Error("some error processing the event"),
  `We are processing the event, ${event.blockHash} (error)`
);

// You can also pass objects to these logs if you want more information to be available in them. eg.:
context.log.info({
  msg: "We are processing the event",
  type: "info",
  extra: "I think this info will help me debug",
  data: { blockHash: event.blockHash },
});
```

// inside your handler
context.log.debug(`We are processing the event, ${event.blockHash} (debug)`);
context.log.info(`We are processing the event, ${event.blockHash} (info)`);
context.log.warn(`We are processing the event, ${event.blockHash} (warn)`);
context.log.error(`We are processing the event, ${event.blockHash} (error)`);
context.log.errorWithExn(
  new Error("some error processing the event"),
  `We are processing the event, ${event.blockHash} (error)`
);
```

<!-- TODO: if we move away from gentype we will be able to make the log argument be an `any` type in typescript - this section will be irrelevant then -->

Unfortunately, currently our typescript bindings only accept strings as arguments to the logs. We have an open issue in our repo to make this unnecessary for the typescript bindings and make it use the `any` type rather than string, but complex logging is done like this:

```typescript
import Logs from "generated/src/Logs.bs.js";

// inside your handler
Logs.debug(context.log, {
  msg: "We are processing the event",
  type: "debug",
  data: { blockHash: event.blockHash },
});
Logs.info(context.log, {
  msg: "We are processing the event",
  type: "info",
  data: { blockHash: event.blockHash },
});
Logs.warn(context.log, {
  msg: "We are processing the event",
  type: "warn",
  data: { blockHash: event.blockHash },
});
Logs.error(context.log, {
  msg: "We are processing the event",
  type: "error",
  data: { blockHash: event.blockHash },
});
Logs.errorWithExn(context.log, new Error("some error in code"), {
  msg: "We are processing the event",
  type: "error",
  data: { blockHash: event.blockHash },
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rescript" label="Rescript">

```rescript
  // inside your handler

  exception ExmapleException(string) // Example of an exception

  /// Some examples of user logging
  context.log.debug(`We are processing the event, ${event.blockHash} (debug)`)
  context.log.info(`We are processing the event, ${event.blockHash} (info)`)
  context.log.warn(`We are processing the event, ${event.blockHash} (warn)`)
  context.log.error(`We are processing the event, ${event.blockHash} (error)`)
  context.log.errorWithExn(
    ExmapleException("some error processing the event"),
    `We are processing the event, ${event.blockHash} (error)`,
  )
```

Unfortunately records in rescript are strictly typed and not polymorphic. So if you want to pass anything that isn't a string to your log messages, you'll need to use this separate log object. as detailed below.

```rescript
  context.log->Logs.debug({
    "msg": "We are processing the event",
    "type": "debug",
    "data": {"blockHash": event.blockHash},
  })
  context.log->Logs.info({
    "msg": "We are processing the event",
    "type": "info",
    "data": {"blockHash": event.blockHash},
  })
  context.log->Logs.warn({
    "msg": "We are processing the event",
    "type": "warn",
    "data": {"blockHash": event.blockHash},
  })
  context.log->Logs.error({
    "msg": "We are processing the event",
    "type": "error",
    "data": {"blockHash": event.blockHash},
  })
  context.log->Logs.errorWithExn(
    ExmapleException("some error processing the event"),
    {
      "msg": "We are processing the event",
      "type": "error",
      "data": {"blockHash": event.blockHash},
    },
  )
```

## Metrics, Debugging, and Troubleshooting

There are many ways to gather insights into our logs. We use the [pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/) logging library for javascript which is highly optimized for performance. It also outputs clear and easy to read logs for users via [pino-pretty](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-pretty).

It is able to output logs in a JSON/machine-readable format for tracing, debugging, or generating metrics via tools such as Kibana. For Kibana it might be useful to use the standardized [ECS](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html), but the pino standard logging format is also fine.

The default output format is pino-pretty. But please feel free to use the following environment variables to modify output formats:

```bash
LOG_STRATEGY="console-pretty" # this is the default format - it logs to the terminal directly with colours for log levels in a human readable format.
LOG_STRATEGY="ecs-file" # this logs to a file specidied at `LOG_FILE` with the ECS log format which is the standard output format for the EKS stack
LOG_STRATEGY="ecs-console" # this logs to the console in the raw ECS format
LOG_STRATEGY="file-only" # this logs to file in default pino format. This is a more efficient logger performance wise.
LOG_STRATEGY="console-raw" # This logs directly to console in pino format.
LOG_STRATEGY="both-prettyconsole" # This pretty prints to console, and logs to file at `LOG_FILE` with default pino format
LOG_FILE="<path-to-log-file>"
```

If there are specific dashboards you'd like to have to improve your experience in development or production please [let us know](https://discord.gg/DhfFhzuJQh). We are working on some Kibana dashboards for self-hosting and UI dashboards into our hosting solution too.

## Developer Logging

The indexer supports the following log levels (in ascending order):

```
- trace
- debug
- info
- udebug
- uinfo
- uwarn
- uerror
- warn
- error
- fatal
```

The log levels prefixed with `u` are user-level logs. These are logs emitted from the context for a handler or a loader.

You can set the log levels with the following environment variables:

```
LOG_LEVEL - the log level used for logs going to the console (default: "info")
FILE_LOG_LEVEL - the log level used for logs going to the file (default: "trace")
```

For example:

```bash
export LOG_LEVEL="trace"
```

will set the log level of the current environment to `trace`.

### Troubleshooting

In development, sometimes it can be nice to turn the Terminal UI off, do this with the `TUI_OFF="true"` environment variable, or the `--tui-off` flag. It is a known issue that the Terminal UI sometimes obfuscates errors and crashes in the terminal, so turning it off can make that process of debugging clearer. Of course, you can add `LOG_STRATEGY="file-only"` or `LOG_STRATEGY="both-prettyconsole"` and view the logs in a file rather than the terminal and keep the TUI running.
