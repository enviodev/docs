## Initialization-Related Errors

### Configuration File Errors (EE100-EE111)

#### `EE100`: Invalid Addresses

**Issue**: The configuration file contains invalid smart contract addresses.

**Solution**: Verify all contract addresses in your configuration file. Ensure they:

- Match the correct format for the blockchain (0x-prefixed for EVM chains)
- Are valid addresses for the specified network
- Have the correct length (42 characters including '0x' for EVM)

#### `EE101`: Non-Unique Contract Names

**Issue**: The configuration file contains duplicate contract names.

**Solution**: Each contract in your configuration must have a unique name. Review your config.yaml and ensure all contract names are unique.

#### `EE102`: Reserved Words in Configuration File

**Issue**: Your configuration uses reserved programming words that conflict with Envio's code generation.

**Solution**:

- Review the [reserved words list](./reserved-words) for JavaScript, TypeScript, and ReScript
- Rename any contract or event names that use reserved words
- Choose descriptive names that don't conflict with programming languages

#### `EE103`: Parse Event Error

**Issue**: Envio couldn't parse event signatures in your configuration.

**Solution**:

- Check your event signatures in the configuration file
- Ensure they match the format in your ABI
- Refer to the [configuration guide](configuration-file) for correct event definition syntax

#### `EE104`: Resolve Config Path

**Issue**: Envio couldn't find your configuration file at the specified path.

**Solution**:

- Verify that your configuration file exists in the correct directory
- Ensure the file is named correctly (usually `config.yaml`)
- Check for file permission issues

#### `EE105`: Deserialize Config

**Issue**: Your configuration file contains invalid YAML syntax.

**Solution**:

- Check your YAML file for syntax errors
- Ensure proper indentation and structure
- Validate your YAML using a linter or validator

#### `EE106`: Undefined Network Config

**Issue**: No `hypersync_config` or `rpc_config` defined for the network specified in your configuration.

**Solution**:

- Add either a HyperSync or RPC configuration for your network
- See the [HyperSync](./hypersync) or [RPC Sync](./rpc-sync) documentation
- Example:
  ```yaml
  network:
    network_id: 1
    rpc_config:
      rpc_url: "https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY"
  ```

#### `EE108`: Invalid Postgres Database Name

**Issue**: The Postgres database name provided doesn't meet requirements.

**Solution**: Provide a database name that:

- Begins with a letter or underscore

**Issue**: An entity field has more than one `@derivedFrom` directive.

**Solution**: Use only one `@derivedFrom` directive per entity. Review your schema and remove duplicate directives.

#### `EE203`: Missing Field Argument for `@derivedFrom`

**Issue**: A `@derivedFrom` directive is missing the required `field` argument.

**Solution**: Add the `field` argument to your `@derivedFrom` directive:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  orders: [Order!]! @derivedFrom(field: "user")
}
```

#### `EE204`: Invalid `@derivedFrom` Argument

**Issue**: The `field` argument in `@derivedFrom` has an invalid value.

**Solution**: Ensure the `field` argument contains a valid string value that matches a field name in the referenced entity.

**Issue**: The schema contains an undefined type.

**Solution**: Use only supported scalar types or defined entity types:

- `ID`
- `String`
- `Int`
- `Float`
- `Boolean`
- `Bytes`
- `BigInt`

#### `EE208`: Unsupported Nullable Scalars

**Issue**: The schema contains nullable scalar types inside lists.

**Solution**: Use non-nullable scalars in lists by adding `!` after the type:

```graphql
# Incorrect
items: [String]

# Correct
items: [String!]!
```

#### `EE209`: Unsupported Multidimensional Lists

**Issue**: The schema contains nullable multidimensional list types.

**Solution**: Ensure inner list types are non-nullable:

```graphql
# Incorrect
matrix: [[Int]]

# Correct
matrix: [[Int!]!]!
```

#### `EE210`: Reserved Words in Schema File

**Issue**: The schema uses reserved programming words.

**Solution**:

- Check the [reserved words list](./reserved-words)
- Rename any entities or fields using reserved words
- Choose alternative descriptive names
