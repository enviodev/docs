## Installation

### Prerequisites

The following are the prerequisite packages required for Envio:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) (use [v18](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v18.18.0/) or newer)
2. [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (use v8 or newer)
3. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

Docker is required specifically for running the Envio indexer locally.

### Install Envio

You can install Envio by running:

```bash
npm i -g envio
```

### Envio CLI

Command to see available CLI commands for Envio is:

```bash
envio --help
```

## Indexer Initalization

Once you have completed the installation step, you can initialize your own indexer via the following options:

### Quickstart

Generate an indexer quickly based on one or more smart contract(s) deployed on a blockchain.

More information on [the Quickstart](./contract-import) can be found in this documentation.

### Templates

Select either the `ERC20`, `Greeter`, or `Blank` template following the `envio init` command.

More information on [the `Greeter` template](./greeter-tutorial) is available.

### Examples

Clone one of the example indexers that have been built using Envio. Reference indexers can be found via our [Explorer](https://envio.dev/explorer), [Tutorials](./tutorial-erc20-token-transfers), or in our [GitHub](https://github.com/enviodev).

> Please take note of the difference in the version of Envio which the indexer was built on and the [latest version on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/envio). There may be some adjustments required to the indexer to be compatible with the latest version of Envio.

## Indexer Configuration

Indexers generated using  the Quickstart, templates, or examples will work without any further configuration.

Users can further configure their indexers to perform custom logic, by modifying the 3 files:

- [`config.yaml`](configuration-file)
- [`schema.graphql`](./schema)
- [`EventHandlers.*`](./event-handlers)

> (\* depending on the language chosen for the indexer)

## Run the Indexer

### Run locally

Users can run the indexer locally without deploying, using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Hasura](https://hasura.io/).

There is more information on [running the indexer locally](./running-locally).

### Deploy to Hosted Service

Once the indexer has been configured, you can easily deploy your indexer to Envio's hosted service and start querying your endpoint.

More information on [the hosted service](./hosted-service) is available.
