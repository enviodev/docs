   Billing & Payment: Fees are charged upfront based on the selected plan. Any additional unit fees exceeding the included base usage will be billed separately at the end of the monthly billing cycle.

   No Refunds: All payments are non-refundable. We do not provide refunds or credits for any unused service, partial subscription periods, downgrades, or cancellations.

   Pricing Changes: We reserve the right to modify our pricing at any time. Any changes will be communicated in advance and will take effect at the start of the next billing cycle.

   Cancellation: Subscriptions can be canceled at any time, but cancellations take effect at the end of the current monthly billing cycle for monthly subscriptions. For annual subscriptions, cancellations will take effect at the end of the current annual billing cycle. Previously paid fees will not be refunded.

   Failed Payments & Account Suspension: If a payment fails, we may retry the charge or suspend access to our services until the outstanding amount is settled. Continued failure to make payment may result in account termination.
