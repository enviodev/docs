## Introduction

Migrating from a subgraph to HyperIndex is designed to be a developer-friendly process. HyperIndex draws strong inspiration from TheGraph’s subgraph architecture, which makes the migration simple, especially with the help of coding assistants like Cursor and AI tools (don't forget to use our ai friendly docs [llm-docs.envio.dev](https://llm-docs.envio.dev)).

The process is simple but requires a good understanding of the underlying concepts. If you are new to HyperIndex, we recommend starting with the [Getting Started](../HyperIndex/getting-started) guide.

## Why Migrate to HyperIndex?

- **Superior Performance**: Up to 100x faster indexing speeds
- **Lower Costs**: Reduced infrastructure requirements and operational expenses
- **Better Developer Experience**: Simplified configuration and deployment
- **Advanced Features**: Access to capabilities not available in other indexing solutions
- **Seamless Integration**: Easy integration with existing GraphQL APIs and applications

## Subgraph to HyperIndex Migration Overview

Migration consists of three major steps:

1. Subgraph.yaml migration
1. Schema migration - near copy paste
1. Event handler migration

At any point in the migration run

`pnpm envio codegen`

to verify the `config.yaml` and `schema.graphql` files are valid.

or run

`pnpm dev`

to verify the indexer is running and indexing correctly.

### 0.5 Use `npx envio init` to generate a boilerplate

As a first step, we recommend using `npx envio init` to generate a boilerplate for your project. This will handle the creation of the `config.yaml` file and a basic `schema.graphql` file with generic handler functions.

### 1. `subgraph.yaml` → `config.yaml`

`npx envio init` will generate this for you. It's a simple configuration file conversion. Effectively specifying which contracts to index, which networks to index (multiple networks can be specified with envio) and which events from those contracts to index.

Take the following conversion as an example, where the `subgraph.yaml` file is converted to `config.yaml` the below comparisons is for the Uniswap v4 pool manager subgraph.

          handler: handleUnsubscription
        - event: Transfer(indexed address,indexed address,indexed uint256)
          handler: handleTransfer  
          ```
</div>
<div className="col col--6">
HyperIndex - `config.yaml`
```yaml

        handler: src/EventHandlers.ts
        events:        
        - event: Subscription(uint256 indexed tokenId, address indexed subscriber)
        - event: Unsubscription(uint256 indexed tokenId, address indexed subscriber)          
        - event: Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed id)
          ```
</div>
</div>

For any potential hurdles, please refer to the [Configuration File](../HyperIndex/configuration-file) documentation.

## 2. Schema migration

`copy` & `paste` the schema from the subgraph to the HyperIndex config file.

Small nuance differences:

- You can remove the `@entity` directive
- [Enums](../HyperIndex/schema#enum-types)
- [BigDecimals](../HyperIndex/schema#working-with-bigdecimal)

## 3. Event handler migration

This consists of two parts

1. Converting assemblyscript to typescript
1. Converting the subgraph syntax to HyperIndex syntax

### 3.1 Converting Assemblyscript to Typescript

The subgraph uses assemblyscript to write event handlers. The HyperIndex syntax is usually in typescript. Since assemblyscript is a subset of typescript, it's quite simple to copy and paste the code, especially so for pure functions.

### 3.2 Converting the subgraph syntax to HyperIndex syntax

There are some subtle differences in the syntax of the subgraph and HyperIndex. Including but not limited to the following:

- Replace Entity.save() with context.Entity.set()
- Convert to async handler functions
- Use `await` for loading entities `const x = await context.Entity.get(id)`
- Use [dynamic contract registration](../HyperIndex/dynamic-contracts) to register contracts

The below code snippets can give you a basic idea of what this difference might look like.

<div className="row">
<div className="col col--6">
theGraph - `eventHandler.ts`
```typescript
export function handleSubscription(event: SubscriptionEvent): void {
  const subscription = new Subscribe(event.transaction.hash + event.logIndex)

subscription.tokenId = event.params.tokenId
subscription.address = event.params.subscriber.toHexString()  
 subscription.logIndex = event.logIndex
subscription.blockNumber = event.block.number
subscription.position = event.params.tokenId

subscription.save()
}
```

</div>
<div className="col col--6">
HyperIndex - `eventHandler.ts`
```typescript
PoolManager.Subscription.handler( async (event, context) => {
  const entity = {
    id: event.transaction.hash + event.logIndex,
    tokenId: event.params.tokenId,
    address: event.params.subscriber,
    blockNumber: event.block.number,
    logIndex: event.logIndex,
    position: event.params.tokenId
  }

context.Subscription.set(entity);
})
```

</div>
</div>

## Extra tips

HyperIndex is a powerful tool that can be used to index any contract. There are some features that are especially powerful that go above subgraph implementations and so in some cases you may want to optimise your migration to HyperIndex further to take advantage of these features. Here are some useful tips:

- Use the `field_selection` option to add additional fields to your index. Doc here: [field selection](../HyperIndex/configuration-file#field-selection)
- Use the `unordered_multichain_mode` option to enable unordered multichain mode, this is the most common need for multichain indexing. However comes with tradeoffs worth understanding. Doc here: [unordered multichain mode](../HyperIndex/configuration-file#unordered-multichain-mode)
- Use wildcard indexing to index by event signatures rather than by contract address.
- HyperIndex uses the standard graphql query language, where as the subgraph uses a custom query language. You can read about the slight nuances [here](https://docs.sablier.com/api/caveats). (We are working on a basic tool to help with backwards compatibility, please check in with us on discord for it's current status).
- Loaders are a powerful feature to optimize historical sync performance. You can read more about them [here](../HyperIndex/loaders).
- HyperIndex is very flexible and can be used to index offchain data too or send messages to a queue etc for fetching external data, you can further optimise the fetching by using the [effects api](../HyperIndex/loaders#effect-api-experimental)
