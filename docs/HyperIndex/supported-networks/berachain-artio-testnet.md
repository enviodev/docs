# Berachain Artio Testnet

## Indexing Berachain Artio Testnet Data with Envio via RPC

:::warning
RPC as a source is not as fast as HyperSync. It is important in production to source RPC data from reliable sources. We recommend our partners at [drpc.org](https://drpc.org). Below, we have provided a set of free endpoints sourced from chainlist.org. **We don't recommend using these in production** as they may be rate limited. We recommend [tweaking the RPC config](./rpc-sync) to accommodate potential rate limiting.
:::

We suggest getting the latest from [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org).

### Overview

Envio supports Berachain Artio Testnet through an RPC-based indexing approach. This method allows you to ingest blockchain data via an RPC endpoint by setting the RPC configuration.
