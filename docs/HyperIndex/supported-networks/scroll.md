### Overview

Envio is a modular hyper-performant data indexing solution for Scroll, enabling applications and developers to efficiently index and aggregate real-time and historical blockchain data. Envio offers three primary solutions for indexing and accessing large amounts of data: [HyperIndex](/docs/HyperIndex/overview) (a customizable indexing framework), [HyperSync](/docs/HyperSync/overview) (a real-time indexed data layer), and [HyperRPC](/docs/HyperSync/overview-hyperrpc) (extremely fast read-only RPC).

HyperSync accelerates the synchronization of historical data on Scroll, enabling what usually takes hours to sync millions of events to be completed in under a minute‚Äîup to 1000x faster than traditional RPC methods.

Designed to optimize the user experience, Envio offers automatic code generation, flexible language support, multi-chain data aggregation, and a reliable, cost-effective hosted service.

To get started, see our documentation or follow our quickstart [guide](/docs/HyperIndex/contract-import).

### Defining Network Configurations

```yaml
name: IndexerName # Specify indexer name
description: Indexer Description # Include indexer description
networks:
  - id: 534352 # Scroll  
    start_block: START_BLOCK_NUMBER  # Specify the starting block
    contracts:
      - name: ContractName
        address:
         - "0xYourContractAddress1"
         - "0xYourContractAddress2"
        handler: ./src/EventHandlers.ts
        events:
          - event: Event # Specify event
          - event: Event
```

With these steps completed, your application will be set to efficiently index Scroll data using Envio‚Äôs blockchain indexer.

For more information on how to set up your config, define a schema, and write event handlers, refer to the guides section in our [documentation](/docs/HyperIndex/configuration-file).
