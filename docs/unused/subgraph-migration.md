<sub><sup> NOTE: Subgraph Migration functionality is in experimental state 👷‍♀️👷 </sup></sub>

This page will show you how to migrate an existing subgraph from theGraph's hosted service onto Envio.

## Migrate the project configuration using Subgraph ID

### Initialize `envio`

```bash
pnpx envio init
```

### Name your indexer

```bash
? Name your indexer:
```

### Choose the project directory (default is the current directory)

```bash
? Set the directory:  (.) .
```

### Select `Subgraph Migration`

```bash
? Choose an initialization option
  Template
  Contract Import
> Subgraph Migration (Experimental)
[↑↓ to move, enter to select, type to filter]
```

### Enter in the subgraph ID

```bash
? [BETA VERSION] What is the subgraph ID?
```

The subgraph ID can be found on [theGraph](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service).

### Choose a language of your choice for the event handlers

```bash
? Which language would you like to use?
> JavaScript
  TypeScript
  ReScript
[↑↓ to move, enter to select, type to filter]
```

This will automatically migrate the network (chain ID and start block) and contract information into the configuration file required for indexing on Envio.

The migration will also import schema and ABI files for the associated contracts.

## Write event handlers

Function names for event handlers will be generated from `pnpx envio init` and the existing event handlers file for the hosted subgraph can be written in the language chosen.

Migration script automatically populates the events section of the config file.
Linking of specific events to entities needs to be done manually. This is required to indicate the entities each event is required to load and update.

## Start the indexer

> Dev note: 📢 make sure you have docker open

The following command will start the docker and create databases for indexed data.

Run

```bash
pnpm envio dev
```

The indexer will then start indexing the contract specified in the `config.yaml` file from the `start_block` specified.

## Troubleshooting

The subgraph migration functionality may timeout if fetching from the IPFS gateway takes longer than the maximum time allowed. This can cause the script to fail.

If you encounter this issue, it means that the automatic migration of the configuration files for the subgraph has been unsuccessful. As a workaround, you'll need to perform the migration of the configuration files for the subgraph manually. Refer to the sections above on how to set up configuration, schema and event handler files.
