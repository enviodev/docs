HyperSync is the state of the art way to extract on-chain data to JSON, Arrow or Parquet files.

HyperIndex heavily relies on HyperSync in order to index more than 100x faster than traditional indexing tools.

This API has been designed from the ground up to provide both speed and flexibility.

The goal is that this API will be the defacto way for you to extract any on-chain data that you need in a faster and more flexible way.
