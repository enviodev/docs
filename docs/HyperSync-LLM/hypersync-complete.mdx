## HyperSync Quickstart

**File:** `quickstart.md`

Get up and running with HyperSync in minutes. This guide will help you start accessing blockchain data at unprecedented speeds with minimal setup.

## Quickest Start: Try LogTUI

Want to see HyperSync in action with zero setup? Try LogTUI, a terminal-based blockchain event viewer:

```bash
# Monitor Aave events on Arbitrum (no installation needed)
pnpx logtui aave arbitrum
```

## Clone the Quickstart Repository

The fastest way to get started is to clone our minimal example repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enviodev/hypersync-quickstart.git
cd hypersync-quickstart
```

This repository contains everything you need to start streaming blockchain data using HyperSync.

## Install Dependencies

```bash
# Using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm install
```

## Choose Your Adventure

The repository includes three different script options, all of which retrieve Uniswap V3 events from Ethereum mainnet:

```bash
# Run minimal version (recommended for beginners)
node run-simple.js

# Run full version with progress bar
node run.js

# Run version with terminal UI
node run-tui.js
```

That's it! You're now streaming data directly from Ethereum mainnet through HyperSync! (TUI version below)

!HyperSync in Action

## Understanding the Code

Let's look at the core concepts in the example code:

### 1. Initialize the Client

```javascript

// Initialize Hypersync client
const client = HypersyncClient.new({
  url: "http://eth.hypersync.xyz", // Change this URL for different networks
});
```

> **Note:** To connect to different networks, see the Supported Networks page for a complete list of available URLs.

### 2. Build Your Query

The heart of HyperSync is the query object, which defines what data you want to retrieve:

```javascript
let query = {
  fromBlock: 0, // Start block (0 = genesis)
  logs: [
    // Filter for specific events
    {
      topics: [topic0_list], // Event signatures we're interested in
    },
  ],
  fieldSelection: {
    // Only return fields we need
    log: [
      LogField.Data,
      LogField.Address,
      LogField.Topic0,
      LogField.Topic1,
      LogField.Topic2,
      LogField.Topic3,
    ],
  },
  joinMode: JoinMode.JoinTransactions, // How to join related data
};
```

### 3. Stream and Process Results

```javascript
// Start streaming events
const stream = await client.stream(query, {});

while (true) {
  const res = await stream.recv();

  // Process results
  if (res.data && res.data.logs) {
    // Do something with the logs
    totalEvents += res.data.logs.length;
  }

  // Update starting block for next batch
  if (res.nextBlock) {
    query.fromBlock = res.nextBlock;
  }
}
```

## Key Concepts for Building Queries

### Filtering Data

HyperSync lets you filter blockchain data in several ways:

- **Log filters**: Find specific events by contract address and event signature
- **Transaction filters**: Filter by sender/receiver addresses, method signatures, etc.
- **Trace filters**: Access internal transactions and state changes (only supported on select networks like Ethereum Mainnet)
- **Block filters**: Get data from specific block ranges

### Field Selection

One of HyperSync's most powerful features is the ability to retrieve only the fields you need:

```javascript
fieldSelection: {
  // Block fields
  block: [BlockField.Number, BlockField.Timestamp],

  // Log fields
  log: [LogField.Address, LogField.Topic0, LogField.Data],

  // Transaction fields
  transaction: [TransactionField.From, TransactionField.To, TransactionField.Value],
}
```

This selective approach dramatically reduces unnecessary data transfer and improves performance.

### Join Modes

HyperSync allows you to control how related data is joined:

- **JoinNothing**: Return only exact matches
- **JoinAll**: Return matches plus all related objects
- **JoinTransactions**: Return matches plus their transactions
- **Default**: Return a reasonable set of related objects

## Examples

### Finding Uniswap V3 Events

This example (from the quickstart repo) streams all Uniswap V3 events from the beginning of Ethereum:

```javascript

import {
  HypersyncClient,
  LogField,
  JoinMode,
} from "@envio-dev/hypersync-client";

// Define Uniswap V3 event signatures
const event_signatures = [
  "PoolCreated(address,address,uint24,int24,address)",
  "Burn(address,int24,int24,uint128,uint256,uint256)",
  "Initialize(uint160,int24)",
  "Mint(address,address,int24,int24,uint128,uint256,uint256)",
  "Swap(address,address,int256,int256,uint160,uint128,int24)",
];

// Create topic0 hashes from event signatures
const topic0_list = event_signatures.map((sig) => keccak256(toHex(sig)));

// Initialize Hypersync client
const client = HypersyncClient.new({
  url: "http://eth.hypersync.xyz",
});

// Define query for Uniswap V3 events
let query = {
  fromBlock: 0,
  logs: [
    {
      topics: [topic0_list],
    },
  ],
  fieldSelection: {
    log: [
      LogField.Data,
      LogField.Address,
      LogField.Topic0,
      LogField.Topic1,
      LogField.Topic2,
      LogField.Topic3,
    ],
  },
  joinMode: JoinMode.JoinTransactions,
};

const main = async () => {
  console.log("Starting Uniswap V3 event scan...");
  const stream = await client.stream(query, {});

  // Process stream...
};

main();
```

## Supported Networks

HyperSync supports 70+ EVM-compatible networks. You can change networks by simply changing the client URL:

```javascript
// Ethereum Mainnet
const client = HypersyncClient.new({ url: "http://eth.hypersync.xyz" });

// Arbitrum
const client = HypersyncClient.new({ url: "http://arbitrum.hypersync.xyz" });

// Base
const client = HypersyncClient.new({ url: "http://base.hypersync.xyz" });
```

See the Supported Networks page for a complete list.

## Using LogTUI

This quickstart repository powers LogTUI, a terminal-based blockchain event viewer built on HyperSync. LogTUI lets you monitor events from popular protocols across multiple chains with zero configuration.

Try it with a single command:

```bash
# Monitor Uniswap events on unichain
pnpx logtui uniswap-v4 unichain

# Monitor Aave events on Arbitrum
pnpx logtui aave arbitrum

# See all available options
pnpx logtui --help
```

LogTUI supports scanning historically for any events across all networks supported by HyperSync.

## Next Steps

You're now ready to build with HyperSync! Here are some resources for diving deeper:

- Client Libraries - Explore language-specific clients
- Query Reference - Learn advanced query techniques
- **Build queries visually** - Use our Intuitive Query Builder
- curl Examples - Test queries directly in your terminal
- Complete Getting Started Guide - More comprehensive guidance

## API Token for Production Use

For development, you can use HyperSync without an API token. For production applications, you'll need to get an API token and update your client initialization:

```javascript
const client = HypersyncClient.new({
  url: "http://eth.hypersync.xyz",
  bearerToken: "your-api-token-here",
});
```

Congratulations! You've taken your first steps with HyperSync, bringing ultra-fast blockchain data access to your applications. Happy building!

## Getting Started with HyperSync

**File:** `hypersync-usage.md`

HyperSync is Envio's high-performance blockchain data engine that provides up to 2000x faster access to blockchain data compared to traditional RPC endpoints. This guide will help you understand how to effectively use HyperSync in your applications.

## Quick Start Video

Watch this quick tutorial to see HyperSync in action:



## Core Concepts

HyperSync revolves around two main concepts:

1. **Queries** - Define what blockchain data you want to retrieve
2. **Output Configuration** - Specify how you want that data formatted and delivered

Think of queries as your data filter and the output configuration as your data processor.

## Building Effective Queries

Queries are the heart of working with HyperSync. They allow you to filter for specific blocks, logs, transactions, and traces.

### Query Structure

A basic HyperSync query contains:

```python
query = hypersync.Query(
    from_block=12345678,               # Required: Starting block number
    to_block=12345778,                 # Optional: Ending block number
    field_selection=field_selection,   # Required: What fields to return
    logs=[log_selection],              # Optional: Filter for specific logs
    transactions=[tx_selection],       # Optional: Filter for specific transactions
    traces=[trace_selection],          # Optional: Filter for specific traces
    include_all_blocks=False,          # Optional: Include blocks with no matches
    max_num_blocks=1000,               # Optional: Limit number of blocks processed
    max_num_transactions=5000,         # Optional: Limit number of transactions processed
    max_num_logs=5000,                 # Optional: Limit number of logs processed
    max_num_traces=5000                # Optional: Limit number of traces processed
)
```

### Field Selection

Field selection allows you to specify exactly which data fields you want to retrieve. This improves performance by only fetching what you need:

```python
field_selection = hypersync.FieldSelection(
    # Block fields you want to retrieve
    block=[
        BlockField.NUMBER,
        BlockField.TIMESTAMP,
        BlockField.HASH
    ],

    # Transaction fields you want to retrieve
    transaction=[
        TransactionField.HASH,
        TransactionField.FROM,
        TransactionField.TO,
        TransactionField.VALUE
    ],

    # Log fields you want to retrieve
    log=[
        LogField.ADDRESS,
        LogField.TOPIC0,
        LogField.TOPIC1,
        LogField.TOPIC2,
        LogField.TOPIC3,
        LogField.DATA,
        LogField.TRANSACTION_HASH
    ],

    # Trace fields you want to retrieve (if applicable)
    trace=[
        TraceField.ACTION_FROM,
        TraceField.ACTION_TO,
        TraceField.ACTION_VALUE
    ]
)
```

### Filtering for Specific Data

For most use cases, you'll want to filter for specific logs, transactions, or traces:

#### Log Selection Example

```python
# Filter for Transfer events from USDC contract
log_selection = hypersync.LogSelection(
    address=["0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48"],  # USDC contract
    topics=[
        ["0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef"]  # Transfer event signature
    ]
)
```

#### Transaction Selection Example

```python
# Filter for transactions to the Uniswap V3 router
tx_selection = hypersync.TransactionSelection(
    to=["0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564"]  # Uniswap V3 Router
)
```

## Processing the Results

HyperSync provides multiple ways to process query results:

### Stream to Parquet Files

Parquet is the recommended format for large data sets:

```python
# Configure output format
config = hypersync.StreamConfig(
    hex_output=hypersync.HexOutput.PREFIXED,
    event_signature="Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)"
)

# Stream results to a Parquet file
await client.collect_parquet("data_directory", query, config)
```

### Stream to JSON Files

For smaller datasets or debugging:

```python
# Stream results to JSON
await client.collect_json("output.json", query, config)
```

### Process Data in Memory

For immediate processing:

```python
# Process data directly
async for result in client.stream(query, config):
    for log in result.logs:
        # Process each log
        print(f"Transfer from {log.event_params['from']} to {log.event_params['to']}")
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

- **Use Appropriate Batch Sizes**: Adjust batch size based on your chain and use case:

  ```python
  config = hypersync.ParquetConfig(
      path="data",
      hex_output=hypersync.HexOutput.PREFIXED,
      batch_size=1000000,  # Process 1M blocks at a time
      concurrency=10,      # Use 10 concurrent workers
  )
  ```

- **Enable Trace Logs**: Set `RUST_LOG=trace` to see detailed progress:

  ```bash
  export RUST_LOG=trace
  ```

- **Paginate Large Queries**: HyperSync requests have a 5-second time limit. For large data sets, paginate results:
  ```python
  current_block = start_block
  while current_block < end_block:
      query.from_block = current_block
      query.to_block = min(current_block + 1000000, end_block)
      result = await client.collect_parquet("data", query, config)
      current_block = result.end_block + 1
  ```

### Network-Specific Considerations

- **High-Volume Networks**: For networks like Ethereum Mainnet, use smaller block ranges or more specific filters
- **Low-Volume Networks**: For smaller chains, you can process the entire chain in one query

## Complete Example

Here's a complete example that fetches all USDC Transfer events:

```python
import hypersync
from hypersync import (
    LogSelection,
    LogField,
    BlockField,
    FieldSelection,
    TransactionField,
    HexOutput
)
import asyncio

async def collect_usdc_transfers():
    # Initialize client
    client = hypersync.HypersyncClient(
        hypersync.ClientConfig(
            url="https://ethereum.hypersync.xyz",
            bearer_token="your-token-here",  # Get from https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperSync/api-tokens
        )
    )

    # Define field selection
    field_selection = hypersync.FieldSelection(
        block=[BlockField.NUMBER, BlockField.TIMESTAMP],
        transaction=[TransactionField.HASH],
        log=[
            LogField.ADDRESS,
            LogField.TOPIC0,
            LogField.TOPIC1,
            LogField.TOPIC2,
            LogField.DATA,
        ]
    )

    # Define query for USDC transfers
    query = hypersync.Query(
        from_block=12000000,
        to_block=12100000,
        field_selection=field_selection,
        logs=[
            LogSelection(
                address=["0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48"],  # USDC contract
                topics=[
                    ["0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef"]  # Transfer signature
                ]
            )
        ]
    )

    # Configure output
    config = hypersync.StreamConfig(
        hex_output=HexOutput.PREFIXED,
        event_signature="Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)"
    )

    # Collect data to a Parquet file
    result = await client.collect_parquet("usdc_transfers", query, config)
    print(f"Processed blocks {query.from_block} to {result.end_block}")

asyncio.run(collect_usdc_transfers())
```

## Decoding Event Logs

When working with blockchain data, event logs contain encoded data that needs to be properly decoded to extract meaningful information. HyperSync provides powerful decoding capabilities to simplify this process.

### Understanding Log Structure

Event logs in Ethereum have the following structure:

- **Address**: The contract that emitted the event
- **Topic0**: The event signature hash (keccak256 of the event signature)
- **Topics 1-3**: Indexed parameters (up to 3)
- **Data**: Non-indexed parameters packed together

### Using the Decoder

HyperSync's client libraries include a `Decoder` class that can parse these raw logs into structured data:

```javascript
// Create a decoder with event signatures
const decoder = Decoder.fromSignatures([
  "Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount)",
  "Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 amount)",
]);

// Decode logs
const decodedLogs = await decoder.decodeLogs(logs);
```

### Single vs. Multiple Event Types

HyperSync provides flexibility to decode different types of event logs:

- **Single Event Type**: For processing one type of event (e.g., only Swap events)

  - See complete example: run-decoder.js

- **Multiple Event Types**: For processing different events from the same contract (e.g., Transfer and Approval)
  - See complete example: run-decoder-multi.js

### Working with Decoded Data

After decoding, you can access the log parameters in a structured way:

- **Indexed parameters**: Available in `decodedLog.indexed` array
- **Non-indexed parameters**: Available in `decodedLog.body` array

Each parameter object contains:

- **name**: The parameter name from the signature
- **type**: The Solidity type
- **val**: The actual value

For example, to access parameters from a Transfer event:

```javascript
// Access indexed parameters (from, to)
const from = decodedLog.indexed[0]?.val.toString();
const to = decodedLog.indexed[1]?.val.toString();

// Access non-indexed parameters (amount)
const amount = decodedLog.body[0]?.val.toString();
```

### Benefits of Using the Decoder

- **Type Safety**: Values are properly converted to their corresponding types
- **Simplified Access**: Direct access to named parameters
- **Batch Processing**: Decode multiple logs with a single call
- **Multiple Event Support**: Handle different event types in the same processing pipeline

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics of using HyperSync:

- Browse the Python Client or other language-specific clients
- Learn about advanced query options
- See example queries for common use cases
- Get your API token to start building

## Understanding HyperSync Queries

A HyperSync query defines what blockchain data you want to retrieve and how you want it returned. Unlike regular RPC calls, HyperSync queries offer:

- **Flexible filtering** across logs, transactions, traces, and blocks
- **Field selection** to retrieve only the data you need
- **Automatic pagination** to handle large result sets
- **Join capabilities** that link related blockchain data together

### Core Concepts

- **Selections**: Define criteria for filtering blockchain data (logs, transactions, traces)
- **Field Selection**: Specify which fields to include in the response
- **Limits**: Control query execution time and response size
- **Joins**: Determine how related data is connected in the response

## Query Execution Process

### How Data is Organized

HyperSync organizes blockchain data into groups of contiguous blocks. When executing a query:

1. The server identifies which block group contains the starting block
2. It processes data groups sequentially until it hits a limit
3. Results are returned along with a `next_block` value for pagination

### Query Limits

HyperSync enforces several types of limits to ensure efficient query execution:

| Limit Type        | Description                                      | Behavior                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Time**          | Server-configured maximum execution time         | May slightly exceed limit to complete current block group |
| **Response Size** | Maximum data returned                            | May slightly exceed limit to complete current block group |
| **to_block**      | User-specified ending block (exclusive)          | Never exceeds this limit                                  |
| **max*num*\***    | User-specified maximum number of results by type | May slightly exceed limit to complete current block group |

### Execution Steps

1. Server receives query and identifies the starting block group
2. It scans each block group, applying selection criteria
3. It joins related data according to the specified join mode
4. When a limit is reached, it finishes processing the current block group
5. It returns results with pagination information

### Understanding Pagination

HyperSync uses a time-based pagination model that differs from traditional RPC calls:

- By default, HyperSync has a **5-second query execution limit**
- Within this time window, it processes as many blocks as possible
- For example, starting with `from_block: 0` might progress to block 10 million in a single request
- Each response includes a `next_block` value indicating where to resume for the next query
- This differs from RPC calls where you typically specify fixed block ranges (e.g., 0-1000)

For most use cases, the `stream` function handles pagination automatically, making it the recommended approach for processing large ranges of blocks.

### Reverse Search

HyperSync supports searching from the head of the chain backwards, which is useful for:

- Block explorers showing the most recent activity
- UIs displaying latest transactions for a user
- Any use case where recent data is more relevant

To use reverse search, add the `reverse: true` parameter to your stream call:

```javascript
// Example of reverse search to get recent transactions
const receiver = await client.stream(query, { reverse: true });

let count = 0;
while (true) {
  let res = await receiver.recv();
  if (res === null) {
    break;
  }
  for (const tx of res.data.transactions) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(tx, null, 2));
  }
  count += res.data.transactions.length;
  if (count >= 20) {
    break;
  }
}
```

With reverse search, HyperSync starts from the latest block and works backwards, allowing you to efficiently access the most recent blockchain data first.

## Query Structure Reference

A complete HyperSync query can include the following components:

```

For a complete list of all available fields, refer to the HyperSync API Reference.

## Response Structure

When you execute a HyperSync query, the response includes both metadata and the requested data:

```rust
struct QueryResponse {
    /// Current height of the blockchain in HyperSync
    archive_height: Optional,

    /// Block number to use as from_block in your next query for pagination
    next_block: u64,

    /// Query execution time in milliseconds
    total_execution_time: u64,

    /// The actual blockchain data matching your query
    data: ResponseData,

    /// Information to help handle chain reorganizations
    rollback_guard: Optional,
}
```

### Rollback Guard

The optional `rollback_guard` helps manage chain reorganizations:

```rust
struct RollbackGuard {
    /// Last block scanned
    block_number: u64,
    timestamp: i64,
    hash: Hash,

    /// First block scanned
    first_block_number: u64,
    first_parent_hash: Hash,
}
```

## Stream and Collect Functions

For continuous data processing or building data pipelines, client libraries provide `stream` and `collect` functions that wrap the base query functionality.

:::caution Tip of Chain Warning
These functions are not designed for use at the blockchain tip where rollbacks may occur. For real-time data near the chain tip, implement a custom loop using the `get` functions and handle rollbacks manually.
:::

### Stream Function

The `stream` function:

- Runs multiple queries concurrently
- Returns a stream handle that yields results as they're available
- Optimizes performance through pipelined decoding/decompression
- Continues until reaching either `to_block` or the chain height at stream start

### Collect Functions

The `collect` functions:

- Call `stream` internally and aggregate results
- Offer different output formats (JSON, Parquet)
- Handle data that may not fit in memory

:::warning Resource Management
Always call `close()` on stream handles when finished to prevent resource leaks, especially if creating multiple streams.
:::

## Working with Join Modes

HyperSync "joins" connect related blockchain data automatically. Unlike SQL joins that combine rows from different tables, HyperSync joins determine which related records to include in the response.

### Default Join Mode (logs → transactions → traces → blocks)

With the default join mode:

1. When you query logs, you automatically get their associated transactions
2. Those transactions' traces are also included
3. The blocks containing these transactions are included

```
┌───────┐     ┌───────────────┐     ┌───────┐     ┌───────┐
│  Logs │ ──> │ Transactions  │ ──> │ Traces│ ──> │ Blocks│
└───────┘     └───────────────┘     └───────┘     └───────┘
```

### JoinAll Mode

JoinAll creates a more comprehensive network of related data:

```
                 ┌─────────────────────────────┐
                 │                             │
                 ▼                             │
┌───────┐  ┌───────────────┐  ┌───────┐  ┌───────┐
│  Logs │      │ Transactions  │      │ Traces│      │ Blocks│
└───────┘      └───────────────┘      └───────┘      └───────┘
```

For example, if you query a trace:

1. You get the transaction that created it
2. You get ALL logs from that transaction (not just the ones matching your criteria)
3. You get ALL traces from that transaction
4. You get the block containing the transaction

### JoinNothing Mode

JoinNothing is the most restrictive:

```
┌───────┐     ┌───────────────┐     ┌───────┐     ┌───────┐
│  Logs │     │ Transactions  │     │ Traces│     │ Blocks│
└───────┘     └───────────────┘     └───────┘     └───────┘
```

Only data directly matching your selection criteria is returned, with no related records included.

## Best Practices

To get the most out of HyperSync queries:

1. **Minimize field selection** - Only request fields you actually need to improve performance
2. **Use appropriate limits** - Set `max_num_*` parameters to control response size
3. **Choose the right join mode** - Use `JoinNothing` for minimal data, `JoinAll` for complete context
4. **Process in chunks** - For large datasets, use pagination or the `stream` function
5. **Consider Parquet** - For analytical workloads, use `collect_parquet` for efficient storage
6. **Handle chain tip carefully** - Near the chain tip, implement custom rollback handling

## HyperSync Preset Queries

**File:** `hypersync-presets.md`

HyperSync's client libraries include helper functions that build common queries. These presets are useful when you need raw blockchain objects without crafting a query manually.

Each preset returns a `Query` object so you can pass it directly to `client.get`, `client.stream`, or `client.collect`.

## Available Presets

### `preset_query_blocks_and_transactions(from_block, to_block)`
Returns every block and all associated transactions within the supplied block range.

```python
import hypersync
import asyncio

async def main():
    client = hypersync.HypersyncClient(hypersync.ClientConfig())

    query = hypersync.preset_query_blocks_and_transactions(17_000_000, 17_000_050)
    result = await client.get(query)
    print(f"Query returned {len(result.data.blocks)} blocks and {len(result.data.transactions)} transactions")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### `preset_query_blocks_and_transaction_hashes(from_block, to_block)`
Returns each block in the range along with only the transaction hashes.

### `preset_query_get_logs(addresses, from_block, to_block)`
Fetches all logs emitted by the provided contract addresses in the given block range.

```python
logs_res = await client.get(
    hypersync.preset_query_get_logs(["0xYourContract"], 17_000_000, 17_000_050)
)
```

### `preset_query_logs(from_block, to_block)`
Fetches every log across the specified blocks.

### `preset_query_logs_of_event(event_signature, from_block, to_block)`
Fetches logs for the specified event signature over the block range.

Client libraries for other languages expose the same presets under similar names. See the Python and Node.js example repositories for more details.

Use these helpers whenever you need a quick query without specifying field selections or joins manually.

## Using curl with HyperSync

**File:** `hypersync-curl-examples.md`

This guide demonstrates how to interact with HyperSync using direct HTTP requests via curl. These examples provide a quick way to explore HyperSync functionality without installing client libraries.

:::info Recommended Approach
We highly recommend trying these curl examples as they're super quick and easy to run directly in your terminal. It's one of the fastest ways to experience HyperSync's performance firsthand and see just how quickly you can retrieve blockchain data without any setup overhead. Simply copy, paste, and be amazed by the response speed!

While curl requests are technically slower than our client libraries (since they use HTTP rather than binary data transfer protocols), they're still impressively fast and provide an excellent demonstration of HyperSync's capabilities without any installation requirements.

- **Data Formats**: Support for efficient formats like Apache Arrow

## Common Use Cases

### Get All ERC-20 Transfers for an Address

This example filters for all ERC-20 transfer events involving a specific address, either as sender or recipient. Feel free to swap your address into the example.

**What this query does:**

- Filters logs for the Transfer event signature (topic0)
- Matches when the address appears in either topic1 (sender) or topic2 (recipient)
- Also includes direct transactions to/from the address

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://eth.hypersync.xyz/query \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "from_block": 0,
    "logs": [
        {
            "topics": [
                [
                    "0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef"
                ],

                ]
            ]
        },
        {
            "topics": [
                [
                    "0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef"

            "value",
            "input"
        ]
    }
}'
```

### Get All Logs for a Smart Contract

This example retrieves all event logs emitted by a specific contract (USDC in this case).

**Key points:**

- Sets `from_block: 0` to scan from the beginning of the chain
- Uses `next_block` in the response for pagination to fetch subsequent data
- Includes relevant block, log, and transaction fields

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://eth.hypersync.xyz/query \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "from_block": 0,
    "logs": [
        {
            "address": ["0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48"]
        }
    ],
    "field_selection": {
        "block": [
            "number",
            "timestamp",
            "hash"
        ],
        "log": [
            "block_number",
            "log_index",
            "transaction_index",
            "data",
            "address",
            "topic0",
            "topic1",
            "topic2",
            "topic3"
        ],
        "transaction": [
            "block_number",
            "transaction_index",
            "hash",
            "from",
            "to",
            "value",
            "input"
        ]
    }
}'
```

### Get Blob Data for the Optimism Chain

This example finds blob transactions used by the Optimism chain for data availability.

**Key points:**

- Starts at a relatively recent block (20,000,000)
- Filters for transactions from the Optimism sequencer address
- Specifically looks for type 3 (blob) transactions
- Results can be used to retrieve the actual blob data from Ethereum

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://eth.hypersync.xyz/query \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "from_block": 20000000,
    "transactions": [
        {
            "from": ["0x6887246668a3b87F54DeB3b94Ba47a6f63F32985"],
            "to": ["0xFF00000000000000000000000000000000000010"],
            "type": [3]
        }
    ],
    "field_selection": {
        "block": [
            "number",
            "timestamp",
            "hash"
        ],
        "transaction": [
            "block_number",
            "transaction_index",
            "hash",
            "from",
            "to",
            "type"
        ]
    }
}'
```

### Get Mint USDC Events

This example identifies USDC token minting events.

**How it works:**

- Filters for the USDC contract address
- Looks for Transfer events (topic0)
- Specifically matches when topic1 (from address) is the zero address, indicating a mint
- Returns detailed information about each mint event

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://eth.hypersync.xyz/query \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "from_block": 0,
    "logs": [
        {
            "address": ["0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48"],
            "topics": [
                [
                    "0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef"
                ],
                [
                    "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
                ],
                []
            ]
        }
    ],
    "field_selection": {
        "block": [
            "number",
            "timestamp",
            "hash"
        ],
        "log": [
            "block_number",
            "log_index",
            "transaction_index",
            "data",
            "address",
            "topic0",
            "topic1",
            "topic2",
            "topic3"
        ],
        "transaction": [
            "block_number",
            "transaction_index",
            "hash",
            "from",
            "to",
            "value",
            "input"
        ]
    }
}'
```

### Get All Transactions for an Address

This example retrieves all transactions where a specific address is either the sender or receiver.

**Implementation notes:**

- Starts from a specific block (15,362,000) for efficiency
- Uses two transaction filters in an OR relationship
- Only includes essential fields in the response
- Multiple queries may be needed for complete history

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://eth.hypersync.xyz/query \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "from_block": 15362000,
    "transactions": [
        {
            "from": ["0xdb255746609baadd67ef44fc15b5e1d04befbca7"]
        },
        {
            "to": ["0xdb255746609baadd67ef44fc15b5e1d04befbca7"]
        }
    ],
    "field_selection": {
        "block": [
            "number",
            "timestamp",
            "hash"
        ],
        "transaction": [
            "block_number",
            "transaction_index",
            "hash",
            "from",
            "to"
        ]
    }
}'
```

### Get Successful or Failed Transactions

This example shows how to filter transactions based on their status (successful or failed) for recent blocks.

**How it works:**

1. First, query the current chain height
2. Calculate a starting point (current height minus 10)
3. Query transactions with status=1 (successful) or status=0 (failed)

```bash
# Get current height and calculate starting block
height=$((`curl https://eth.hypersync.xyz/height | jq .height` - 10))

# Query successful transactions (change status to 0 for failed transactions)
curl --request POST \
  --url https://eth.hypersync.xyz/query \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data "{
    \"from_block\": ${height},
    \"transactions\": [
        {
            \"status\": 1
        }
    ],
    \"field_selection\": {
        \"block\": [
            \"number\",
            \"timestamp\",
            \"hash\"
        ],
        \"transaction\": [
            \"block_number\",
            \"transaction_index\",
            \"hash\",
            \"from\",
            \"to\"
        ]
    }
  }"
```

## Api Tokens

**File:** `api-tokens.mdx`



# API Tokens for HyperSync

## Overview

API tokens provide authenticated access to HyperSync services, enabling enhanced capabilities and usage tracking. While currently optional, they will become mandatory in the future and offer significant advantages for serious usage.

**Starting from 21 May 2025**, you will still be able to use HyperSync without API tokens, but **rate limits will be applied**. The service will remain **free to use until mid-June**. From **mid-June onwards**, we will introduce a set of **tiered packages based on usage**. Indexers deployed to our hosted service will have special access to HyperSync that does not require a custom API token.

## Table of Contents

- Benefits of Using API Tokens
- Generating API Tokens
- Implementation Guide
- Security Best Practices

## Benefits of Using API Tokens

Using API tokens with HyperSync provides several advantages:

- **Dedicated Resources**: Access to reserved capacity and bandwidth
- **Performance Guarantees**: Higher quality of service with better reliability
- **Usage Analytics**: Track and monitor your consumption patterns
- **Future-Proofing**: Early adoption before tokens become mandatory
- **Enhanced Support**: Better visibility for troubleshooting assistance

## Generating API Tokens

You can generate API tokens through the Envio Dashboard:

1. Visit https://envio.dev/app/api-tokens
2. Sign in to your account (or create one if you don't have one)
3. Follow the prompts to create a new token
4. Copy and securely store your token

## Implementation Guide

To use an API token, pass it as a `bearer_token` when creating a HyperSync client:


  

```typescript
const client = HypersyncClient.new({
  url: "https://eth.hypersync.xyz",
  bearerToken: process.env.HYPERSYNC_BEARER_TOKEN,
});
```

  
  

```python
client = hypersync.HypersyncClient(hypersync.ClientConfig(
    url="https://eth.hypersync.xyz",
    bearer_token=os.environ.get("HYPERSYNC_BEARER_TOKEN")
))
```

  
  

```rust
let client = Client::new(ClientConfig {
    bearer_token: Some(std::env::var("HYPERSYNC_BEARER_TOKEN").unwrap_or_default()),
    ..Default::default()
})
.unwrap();
```

  


## Understanding Usage

To understand your current month's usage, visit https://envio.dev/app/api-tokens. Usage is composed of two main components:

- **Number of Requests**: The total count of API requests made.
- **Credits**: A comprehensive calculation that takes into account multiple factors including data bandwidth, disk read operations, and other resource utilization metrics. This provides the most accurate representation of actual service usage. We're happy to provide more detailed breakdowns of the credit calculation upon request.

## Security Best Practices

When working with API tokens:

- **Never commit tokens to git repositories**
- **Use environment variables** to store tokens instead of hardcoding
- **Add token files like `.env` to your `.gitignore**
- **Rotate tokens periodically** for enhanced security
- **Limit token sharing** to only those who require access

```bash
# Example .env file
HYPERSYNC_BEARER_TOKEN=your_secret_token_here
```

This approach keeps your tokens secure while making them available to your application at runtime.

## Analyzing All Transactions To and From an Address

**File:** `tutorial-address-transactions.md`

## Introduction

Understanding all transactions to and from an address is an interesting use case. Traditionally extracting this information would be very difficult with an RPC. In this tutorial, we'll introduce you to the evm-address-summary tool, which uses HyperSync to efficiently extract all transactions associated with a specific address.

## About evm-address-summary

The evm-address-summary repository contains a collection of scripts designed to get activity related to an address. These scripts leverage HyperSync's efficient data access to make complex address analysis simple and quick.

**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/enviodev/evm-address-summary

## Available Scripts

The repository offers several specialized scripts:

1. **All Transfers**: This script scans the entire blockchain (from block 0 to the present) and retrieves all relevant transactions for the given address. It iterates through these transactions and sums up their values to calculate aggregates for each token.

2. **NFT Holders**: This script scans the entire blockchain and retrieves all token transfer events for an ERC721 address. It records all the owners of these tokens and how many tokens they have traded in the past.

3. **ERC20 Transfers and Approvals**: This script scans the blockchain and retrieves all ERC20 transfer and approval events for the given address.

It calculates the following:

- **Token balances**: Summing up all incoming and outgoing transfers for each token
- **Token transaction counts**: Counting the number of incoming and outgoing transactions for each token
- **Approvals**: Tracking approvals for each token, including the spender and approved amount

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or newer)
- pnpm (recommended)
- Git

### Basic Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/enviodev/evm-address-summary.git
   cd evm-address-summary
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Run a Script** (example with all-transfers)
   ```bash
   pnpm run all-transfers 0xYourAddressHere
   ```

For complete details on all available scripts, their usage, and example outputs, refer to the project README.

## Customizing Network Endpoints

The scripts work with any network supported by HyperSync. To change networks, edit the `hyperSyncEndpoint` in the appropriate config file:

```typescript
// For Ethereum Mainnet
export const hyperSyncEndpoint = "https://eth.hypersync.xyz";
```

For a complete list of supported networks, see our HyperSync Supported Networks documentation.

## Practical Use Cases

One powerful application is measuring value at risk for any address, similar to revoke.cash. You can quickly scan an address to find all approvals and transfers to easily determine any outstanding approvals on any token. This helps identify potential security risks from forgotten token approvals.

Other use cases include:

- Portfolio tracking and analysis
- Auditing transaction history
- Research on token holder behavior
- Monitoring NFT ownership changes

## Next Steps

- Check out the evm-address-summary repository for full documentation
- Explore the source code to understand how HyperSync is used for data retrieval
- Try modifying the scripts for your specific use cases
- Learn more about HyperSync's capabilities for blockchain data analysis

For any questions or support, join our Discord community or create an issue on the GitHub repository.

## HyperRPC: Ultra-Fast Read-Only RPC

**File:** `HyperRPC/overview-hyperrpc.md`

HyperRPC is an extremely fast read-only RPC designed specifically for data-intensive blockchain tasks. Built from the ground up to optimize performance, it offers a simple drop-in solution with dramatic speed improvements over traditional nodes.

:::info HyperSync vs. HyperRPC
**For most use cases, we recommend using HyperSync over HyperRPC.**

HyperSync provides significantly faster performance and much greater flexibility in how you query and filter blockchain data. Behind the scenes, HyperRPC actually uses HyperSync to fulfill requests.

**When to use HyperRPC:**

- When you need a simple drop-in replacement for existing RPC-based code
- When you don't have time for a deeper integration
- When you're working with tools that expect standard JSON-RPC interfaces

**When to use HyperSync:**

- When performance is critical (HyperSync is much faster)
- When you need advanced filtering capabilities
- When you want more control over data formatting and field selection
- For new projects where you're designing the data access layer

## What is HyperRPC?

HyperRPC is a specialized JSON-RPC endpoint that focuses exclusively on **read operations** to deliver exceptional performance. By optimizing specifically for data retrieval workflows, HyperRPC can significantly outperform traditional nodes for data-intensive applications.

Key characteristics:

- **Read-only**: Optimized for data retrieval (cannot send transactions)
- **Drop-in compatible**: Works with existing tooling that uses standard RPC methods
- **Specialized**: Designed specifically for data-intensive operations like `eth_getLogs`

## Performance Advantages

Early benchmarks show that HyperRPC can deliver up to **5x performance improvement** for data-intensive operations compared to traditional nodes like `geth`, `erigon`, and `reth`.

This performance boost is particularly noticeable for:

- Historical data queries
- Log event filtering
- Block and transaction retrievals
- Analytics applications

## Supported Methods

HyperRPC currently supports the following Ethereum JSON-RPC methods:

| Category             | Methods                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chain Data**       | `eth_chainId``eth_blockNumber`                                                                                                                    |
| **Block Data**       | `eth_getBlockByNumber``eth_getBlockByHash``eth_getBlockReceipts`                                                                            |
| **Transaction Data** | `eth_getTransactionByHash``eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex``eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex``eth_getTransactionReceipt` |
| **Event Logs**       | `eth_getLogs`                                                                                                                                           |
| **Traces**           | `trace_block` (only on select chains)                                                                                  |

## Supported Networks

HyperRPC is available across numerous EVM-compatible networks. For the most up-to-date list of supported chains, please see our Supported Networks page.

## Getting Started

To start using HyperRPC:

1. **Get Access**:

   - Visit our Supported Networks page to find all available HyperRPC endpoints
   - Each network has a ready-to-use URL that you can start using immediately

2. **Add Your API Token** (recommended):

   - Requests without an API token will be rate limited starting **June 2025** (same timeline as HyperSync).
   - Append your token to the endpoint URL. Example:

     ```text
     https://100.rpc.hypersync.xyz/
     ```

   - If you don't have a token yet, you can generate one through the Envio Dashboard.

3. **Use Like a Standard RPC**:

   ```javascript
   // Example: Fetching logs with HyperRPC
   const response = await fetch("https://100.rpc.hypersync.xyz/", {
     method: "POST",
     headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       jsonrpc: "2.0",
       id: 1,
       method: "eth_getLogs",
       params: [
         {
           fromBlock: "0x1000000",
           toBlock: "0x1000100",
           address: "0xYourContractAddress",
         },
       ],
     }),
   });
   ```

## Hyperfuel

**File:** `HyperFuel/hyperfuel.md`

HyperSync is a high-performance data node and accelerated data query layer that powers Envio’s Indexing framework, HyperIndex, for up to 1000x faster data retrieval than standard RPC methods.

HyperFuel is HyperSync adapted for the Fuel Network and is exposed as a low-level API for developers and data analysts to create flexible, high-speed queries for all fuel data.

Users can interact with the HyperFuel in Rust, Python, NodeJS clients, or directly via the JSON API to extract data into parquet files, arrow format, or as typed data. Client examples are listed furhter below.

Using HyperFuel, application developers can easily sync and search large datasets in a few minutes. HyperFuel is an ideal solution for indexers, block explorers, data analysts, bridges, and other applications or use cases focused on performance.

You can integrate with HyperFuel using any of our clients:

- Rust: https://github.com/enviodev/hyperfuel-client-rust
- Python: https://github.com/enviodev/hyperfuel-client-python
- Nodejs: https://github.com/enviodev/hyperfuel-client-node
- JSON API: https://github.com/enviodev/hyperfuel-json-api


:::info
HyperFuel supports Fuel mainnet and testnet: 
Mainnet: https://fuel.hypersync.xyz 
Testnet: https://fuel-testnet.hypersync.xyz
:::


## Example usage

Below is an example of a Hyperfuel query in each of our clients searching the first 1,300,000 blocks for all `input` objects of a specific `asset-id`. This example returns 10,543 inputs in around 100ms - not including latency.

## Rust (repo)

```rust
use std::num::NonZeroU64;

use hyperfuel_client::{Client, Config};
use hyperfuel_net_types::Query;
use url::Url;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let client_config = Config {

        bearer_token: None,
        http_req_timeout_millis: NonZeroU64::new(30000).unwrap(),
    };
    let client = Client::new(client_config).unwrap();

    // Construct query in json.  Can also construct it as a typed struct (see predicate-root example)
    let query: Query = serde_json::from_value(serde_json::json!({
        // start query from block 0
        "from_block": 0,
        // if to_block is not set, query runs to the end of the chain
        "to_block":   1300000,
        // load inputs that have `asset_id` = 0x2a0d0ed9d2217ec7f32dcd9a1902ce2a66d68437aeff84e3a3cc8bebee0d2eea

## Query Structure

**File:** `HyperFuel/hyperfuel-query.md`

This section is dedicated to giving an exhaustive list of all the fields and query parameters of a HyperFuel query.  HyperFuel is extremely powerful but learning how to craft queries can take some practice.  It is recommended to look at the examples and reference this page.  HyperFuel query structure is the same across clients.

# Top-level query structure
Illustrated as json
```json
{
    // The block to start the query from
    "from_block": Number,

    // The block to end the query at. If not specified, the query will go until the
    //  end of data. Exclusive, the returned range will be [from_block..to_block).
    //
    // The query will return before it reaches this target block if it hits the time limit
    //  configured on the server. The user should continue their query by putting the
    //  next_block field in the response into from_block field of their next query. This implements
    //  pagination.
    "to_block": Number, // Optional, defaults to latest block

    // List of receipt selections, the query will return receipts that match any of these selections.
    // All selections have an OR relationship with each other.
    "receipts": [{ReceiptSelection}], // Optional

    // List of input selections, the query will return inputs that match any of these selections.
    // All selections have an OR relationship with each other.
    "inputs": [{InputSelection}], // Optional

    // List of output selections, the query will return outputs that match any of these selections.
    // All selections have an OR relationship with each other.
    "outputs": [{OutputSelection}], // Optional

    // Whether to include all blocks regardless of whether they match a receipt, input, or output selection.  Normally
    // The server will return only the blocks that are related to the receipts, inputs, or outputs in the response. But if this
    //  is set to true, the server will return data for all blocks in the requested range from_block, to_block).
    "include_all_blocks": bool, // Optional, defaults to false

    // The user selects which fields they want returned. Requesting fewer fields will improve
    //  query execution time and reduce the payload size so the user should always use a minimal number of fields.
    "field_selection": {FieldSelection},

    // Maximum number of blocks that should be returned, the server might return more blocks than this number but
    //It won't overshoot by too much.
    "max_num_blocks": Number, // Optional, defaults to no maximum
}
```

# ReceiptSelection
The query takes an array of ReceiptSelection objects and returns receipts that match any of the selections.  All fields are optional.
Below is an exhaustive list of all fields in a ReceiptSelection JSON object.  Reference the [Fuel docs on receipts for field explanations.

```json
{
    // address that emitted the receipt
    "root_contract_id": [String],

    // The recipient address
    "to_address": [String],

    // The asset id of the coins transferred.
    "asset_id": [String],

    // the type of receipt
    // 0 = Call
    // 1 = Return,
    // 2 = ReturnData,
    // 3 = Panic,
    // 4 = Revert,
    // 5 = Log,
    // 6 = LogData,
    // 7 = Transfer,
    // 8 = TransferOut,
    // 9 = ScriptResult,
    // 10 = MessageOut,
    // 11 = Mint,
    // 12 = Burn,
    "receipt_type": [Number],

    // The address of the message sender.
    "sender": [String],

    // The address of the message recipient.
    "recipient": [String],

    // The contract id of the current context is in an internal context. null otherwise
    "contract_id": [String],

    // receipt register values.
    "ra": [Number],
    "rb": [Number],
    "rc": [Number],
    "rd": [Number],

    // the status of the transaction that the receipt originated from
    // 1 = Success
    // 3 = Failure
    "tx_status": [Number],

    // the type of the transaction that the receipt originated from
    // 0 = script
    // 1 = create
    // 2 = mint
    // 3 = upgrade
    // 4 = upload
    "tx_type": [Number]
}
```

# InputSelection
The query takes an array of InputSelection objects and returns inputs that match any of the selections.  All fields are optional.
Below is an exhaustive list of all fields in an InputSelection JSON object.  Reference the Fuel docs on inputs for field explanations.
```json
{
    // The owning address or predicate root.
    "owner": [String],

    // The asset ID of the coins.
    "asset_id": [String],

    // The input contract.
    "contract": [String],

    // The sender address of the message.
    "sender": [String],

    // The recipient address of the message.
    "recipient": [String],

    // The type of input
    // 0 = InputCoin,
    // 1 = InputContract,
    // 2 = InputMessage,
    "input_type": [Number],

    // the status of the transaction that the input originated from
    // 1 = Success
    // 3 = Failure
    "tx_status": [Number],

    // the type of the transaction that the input originated from
    // 0 = script
    // 1 = create
    // 2 = mint
    // 3 = upgrade
    // 4 = upload
    "tx_type": [Number]
}
```

# OutputSelection
The query takes an array of OutputSelection objects and returns outputs that match any of the selections.  All fields are optional.
Below is an exhaustive list of all fields in an OutputSelection JSON object.  Reference the Fuel docs on outputs for field explanations.
```json
{
    // The address the coins were sent to.
    "to": [String],

    // The asset id for the coins sent.
    "asset_id": [String],

    // The contract that was created.
    "contract": [String],

    // the type of output
    // 0 = CoinOutput,
    // 1 = ContractOutput,
    // 2 = ChangeOutput,
    // 3 = VariableOutput,
    // 4 = ContractCreated,
    "output_type": [Number],

    // the status of the transaction that the input originated from
    // 1 = Success
    // 3 = Failure
    "tx_status": [Number],

    // the type of the transaction that the input originated from
    // 0 = script
    // 1 = create
    // 2 = mint
    // 3 = upgrade
    // 4 = upload
    "tx_type": [Number]
}
```

# FieldSelection
The query takes a FieldSelection JSON object where the user specifies what they want returned from data matched by their `ReceiptSelection`, `OutputSelection`, and `InputSelection`.  There is no `BlockSelection` or `TransactionSelection` because the query returns all blocks and transactions that include the data you specified in your `ReceiptSelection`, `OutputSelection`, or `InputSelection`.

For best performance, select a minimal amount of fields.

*Important note:* all fields draw inspiration from Fuel's graphql schema.  Mainly Blocks, Transactions, Receipts, Inputs, and Outputs.  Enums of each type (ex: Receipt has 12 different types, two of which are Log and LogData, Input has 3: InputCoin, InputContract, InputMessage, and Output has 5: CoinOutput, ContractOutput, ChangeOutput, VariableOutput, ContractCreated) are flattened into the parent type.  This is why  multiple fields on any returned Receipt, Input, or Output might be null; it's not a field on all possible enums of that type, so null is inserted.

All fields are optional.  Below is an exhaustive list of all fields in a FieldSelection JSON object.
```json

    "block": [
        "id",
